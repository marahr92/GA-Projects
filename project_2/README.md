**KEY FINDINGS**

---
The key findings were that there were several features that had high correlation with the sales price with at least 0.6 positive correlation, there was not any inverse correlation to note. So we decided to take these features and review it once more to see if there are any further multicollinearity between each selected features. We decided to drop those features and used the rest for the model. The model had a good r2 score of at least 0.8 between the train and test set as well it had less than 0.1 change.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

This project seeks to identify the underachieving states that have low participation rates and low mean scores in order to focus more attention to these states that require more help.

**KEY FINDINGS**
Some findings from these few datasets were that although some states had the lower participation rates they tend to do really well and in these states they do not require to take either of the tests. Meaning that these students are either academically inclined and they have a strong desire to go to college which in return gets them the good scores. 

On the other hand the states that had higher participation rates some of them had below average scores. As most of these states had some kind of requirement to take either tests and complete the exit school exam. The students may have decided to complete either tests as a formality as their exit school exam takes priority.

**CONCLUSION**
We have also found a few underachieving states that have low participation rates and low mean scores. We have broken up these few schools into 2 groups. One group that the states do not require the students to be taking the ACT or SAT. The second group, the states that require taking the SAT or ACT.

For those schools (Alaska, Oregon and Texas) that does not require the SAT or ACT, they could be encouraged to take it up as the current indication is that in general their students are not doing very well in schools. Our recommendation will be to focus on these states and improving their programs. Encouraging the students to take up the test so that they will be college ready.

For those which require SAT or ACT (Ohio and Oklahoma), more investigation will be needed to find out the reasons for low participation rates and total scores. As participation in the SAT or ACT is a requirement to complete high school, why are the students not participating the tests? Our recommendation for these states will be to look into firstly the low participation rates and the causes behind it.

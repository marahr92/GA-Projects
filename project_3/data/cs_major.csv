csMajors,"Wanted to make a post about this to hopefully inspire some other people who go to low ranked schools. Just gonna talk about my advice and general things I learned doing this :) Im doxxing myself but idrc connect with me on linkedin.

Going into College I had already started padding my resume with a lot of freelancing work. I did a lot of webdev and I learned that for resume stuff you kind of just have to sell yourself well. I wrote my projects and experiences in way that sounded impressive, but not like I was lying out my ass or something. So going into Summer 2022 recruiting I had decently full resume, and only 1 ""internship"" I did with a local company. 

**Summer 2022**

Started off looking for internships last summer, I was ambitious at the time so I didn't really second doubt myself with school name. I just applied to big tech companies and I got a decent response from a lot of them. This was also my first time doing leetcode, did it at the same time as recruiting and it was a terrible mistake. I prioritized making fancy projects instead of leetcoding, and because of this I failed almost every interview I had. I got incredibly lucky around February and landed a React interview instead of leetcode, and got the offer I ended up accepting. 

Failed: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft

Accepted: DocuSign

**Fall 2022**

At this point I was pretty happy with my first internship, but interviewing with big tech left me wanting more. I tried for an offseason internship, but this season went the same as the last. Consisted of a lot of cram studying for interviews and it felt like I wasn't retaining anything at all. Failed more companies.

Failed: Cockroach Labs, Spotify, Google, Rippling, Bitgo (got offer, but they rescinded lol) 

Accepted: Coinbase

**Winter 2023**

Same deal lol, my motivation was definitely ruined after failing Google, I failed every company I interviewed with even though my interview performance was actually improving. At this point I was just happy to be getting these interviews.

Failed: Datadog, LinkedIn, Asana, Figma, HubSpot  
**Summer 2023**

I accepted 2 offers really early on, didn't go through the hassle of applying to a ton of companies, only applied to 2 and got the offers. Granted the interviews were way easier then they probably should have. Got the Slack offer via an event they did and Amazon because I applied early.

Failed: None  
Accepted: Amazon (thought they would do offseason, they are not.), Slack

**Final Thoughts**

 I recommend people from similar schools to fluff your resume with anything, if you can get some local work thats 100% okay as you will eventually work your way up the ladder. I also highly recommend studying leetcode and being prepared for bigtech interviews once you get them. If you're constantly improving your resume it is almost a guarantee you will get an interview one day, wether it's soon, or after you graduate. Don't let your school name limit you. I see it all too often where people at my school focus on class until they graduate, and settle with companies in my area. Of course thats fine, but if you want more, you can't set a limit for yourself.",How I got good internships from a T200 school
csMajors,,How to renegotiate intern offer or try to get it in a different time such as fall or spring instead of summer
csMajors,"I applied to around 200 internships this season and I ended up receiving two offers, one from UHG/Optum and one from Cigna. This is my first internship and I'm conflicted because both are pretty similar in that they are both major healthcare companies (I think both are pretty highly ranked in Fortune 500). I want some advice or feedback on which one I should end up choosing.

Cigna

\- $27/hr (12 weeks)

\- Housing and relocation are provided

\- Hybrid (3 days in office, 2 days remote)

\- I think I will have the chance to voice my opinion on which role and team I want to be in later after accepting the offer

&amp;#x200B;

UHG/Optum:

\- $29/hr (10 weeks)

\- I'm pretty sure they will provide housing and relocation, but I'm not sure if its 100% covered

\- Again, hybrid style

\- I'm not sure if I will be placed in a team I want to be in

&amp;#x200B;

What would you guys choose? Both are 'technology program' internship opportunities, meaning I don't have a 100% guarantee in the team I want to be in (software engineering). In terms of pay, I don't care as they will be roughly the same.

csMajors,"I've asked a lot of questions and learned a lot from this subreddit so I thought after finally making it that I'd share some valuable lessons I learned from my experiences in more than 20 interviews.

1. Don't just do leetcode.

I've been asked leetcode type questions in less than half of my interviews. There are lots of other things you need to be familiar with like system design, software design patterns and some basic knowledge about OS and computer architecture will go a long way.

2. Get any experience you can.

If you don't have any internships just try to get any gig at your university that is relevant to the field in any type of way.

3. The best way to learn is by doing.

I was able to ace my system design interviews only when I actually tried to design web apps and researched all the different things related to cloud and scale. Don't just memorize a few keywords and expect to get it.

4. Make your projects visually engaging and unique.

There is this project that I didn't even have on my resume that I just mentioned in an interview, and 3 people from that team went on my LinkedIn to see it, because it was interactive and a unique idea.

5. Don't get discouraged (seriously).

Companies are facing tough times these days, so a rejection might be more of a sign of the performance of the company than your own performance. I've been ghosted and rejected from QA roles at mediocre companies, but in the end I got a swe offer from a top place. Just keep working on your skills and show off your progress until you get it.

Note: I can't disclose the details of my offer because I signed an nda but I'm very happy with it.",JUST GOT MY DREAM OFFER!

csMajors,"Hi! First of all, I'm a second year CS student from Romania, so my experiences my vary from yours.  


As the title says, I've been thinking of switching majors to a non-STEM related field for a long while now. Which is a bit crazy if I try to think about it logically, because I've spent 4 years in high-school studying 'intensive' CS (about 6 or 7 hours of it a week), I've been to a programming Olympiad (where I got a bottom-of-the list, very low score),  then went to college and got all 10s (highest grade) during the first semester in all but one course, Maths, where I got a 9. I also had very good grades during the the second semester, though no 10s this time around.  


I'm a bit of an oddity because I managed to pass all the theoretical courses that others found difficult, such as Data Structures and Logic and I have no qualms about writing papers, but I struggle immensely with actually writing code and any course related to it: OOP, Python, Computer Networks, etc. I would have actually failed my Programming 101 class where we had to do a project in teams, because I was incredibly slow at implementing all the features, had I not worked with a student who finished his tasks very quickly and managed to do what I failed to. Even now I have a Computer Networks assignment where we are supposed to develop another piece of software, and I can't wrap my head around it. It's frustrating, and I've attended the lectures and the laboratories, I understand what I am supposed to do in theory, but I am just bad at designing the architecture of the app and creating all the modular services and systems that should interact with one another.  


Truth be told, I have very little interest in technology and programming, and I only got into this field in hopes of making money. I also avoid coding in my spare time, which might have gotten me 'rusty', while that colleague of mine I told you about does it regularly and also has a job he enjoys in this field. I take very little to no pleasure from coding. I don't hate it, it's just a thing that I have no particular affinity for, like a very bland-tasting food, though I have learnt to admire the people who are actually good at it, because I've seen how difficult it is. On the other hand, in my leisure time, I enjoy reading books, writing and learning about history, which is why I was thinking of switching to a Humanities-related field, like Literature, History or Anthropology.   


If you were in my stead, would you switch majors or stick with CS?",Should I switch majors from CS to a different field?
csMajors,"I am a junior right now with a 3.5 GPA at Rutgers. I've been applying for internships since September. I was a little late to the party. I applied to Capital One (they recruit a lot from my school) on September 14 and that was too late. I was honestly most hopeful about Capital One and thought that's where I would end up. I did their CodeSignal last year, but they rejected me because I was a sophomore. Anyways, with no LC grinding last semester I passed their Code Signal (as I learnt this semester in an email they sent). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I've been applying to a ton of companies. Big, small, medium. I've done several code signals and HackerRanks, some I've done well on, others, not so much.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I am really bad OAs. I didn't grind LC much this summer due to personal reasons. I did work on my side projects however and they are up on GitHub with documentation and on my Resume. The OAs I do well on have pretty long time limits. I am bad at writing efficient code under pressure. This is merely a practice problem: I am sure the more I do, the better I will get at it. However, with school and some other obligations, I just don't have time to grind LC right now. During my winter break, I plan to grind LC non stop and ""tackle the coding interview.""

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know if I will get an internship this year. I really want to do an internship before I graduate, but I just don't know if I can. Even if I start getting in good attempts in January, I don't know if I will have a fighting chance, given the current state of things right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't know what to do. Getting a full time job with no experience, as I've heard, is rough as a new grad and with how things are going, I don't know if it will even be possible. Even if I do land a full time job, my lack of real world experience concerns me: what if I am not good enough for that job because I didn't have the prior 12 weeks of experience?

&amp;#x200B;

The other idea I thought of is spend another year in school. My tuition is pretty cheap and I can afford it. It will also give me a chance to complete my minor.  I can also spend another two years in school and do my masters in CS too. This gives me a few more summers. I am also applying to spring and fall internships, I wouldn't mind taking a semester off from school in order to work (my school doesn't have co-op as far as I know). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't know what to do. Should I spend another year on my bachelors and do my minor while continuing to try and get a CS internship? Do I still have a chance come this January after I've gotten some LC prep in me? I'm kinda lost. I did the Citadel OA today and I got the first question, but the second question I ran out of time and only passed two test cases (arguably the easier one). I am just not good at OAs, I've flunked Roblox, Google, eBay, JP Morgan. I have a pending TikTok OA that I don't expect to do well on, historically, TikTok has hard OAs. I feel like I did well on the Oracle OA, but they've ghosted me as they did everyone else. Vanguard too, I think I did well in, but I got ghosted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just feeling a bit discouraged and kinda don't know what to do. On one hand, the perfectionist in me really wants to do an internship before I graduate, but on the other hand, I am wasting a year getting a minor I don't really need taking a risk on getting a summer of 2024 internship I may not even get.

csMajors,"Hi all,

This season, I applied to over 300 companies for a 2023 internship. As opposed to last year most of the companies (\~200) have not sent me a response, and I think this happened to a good amount of others as well. So, I decided to share the companies that were nice enough to respond &amp; reject me fast for you to apply to and get a fast response! (Almost all of these companies pay over $40/hr for the internship)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, enjoy and good luck!

One guy has done at least 80% of the work. When the project was just beginning i hopped in voice chat with him and another partner but was very quickly getting lost on how to implement the things he wanted. I figured I should probably try and contribute as early as possible because It will only get more confusing for me the bigger the project gets. I sat there for a few hours with them researching things but became so overwhelmed i didn’t even know where to begin. It got late and eventually I went to bed but he continued working on the project alone until like 3am. This was only like a week and a half in and when i looked at it the next day I was completely lost in the code. Don’t get me wrong, what he did was an amazing amount of work and it was functional, but I just didn’t understand how a majority of it worked. It eventually reached a point where I had absolutely nothing to contribute because I am simply not as skilled as my partners. I didn’t know how to implement the things required and felt completely useless. Now here we are today where i’m supposed to present this project with them but am completely lost on it.

csMajors,"Hi guys,

I'm incredibly fortunate to have received these internship offers for next summer and I'm actually pretty torn between the 2 of these. Which would be better for career progression?

Capital one: $61/hr (+ housing), Mclean, VA

Blackrock: $55/hr, NYC, Aladdin Product Group

I feel like blackrock would've been a no brainer if they subsidized housing, but they don't, and I'm sure food, etc will also be more expensive in NYC too. I'm leaning towards blackrock cause it seemed to have a very selective hiring process as well and I feel like C1 kind of has a low hiring bar relatively. But also I'm not sure if blackrock will really open as many doors for me as people say.. I read somewhere that kind of only helps if you want to go into HFTs which I'm not necessarily interested in. I also heard WLB at C1 is pretty good too, not so cure about Blackrock.

Regarding return offers, is there any consensus as to how frequently both these companies give out return offers? It seemed new grad salaries are similar too.

Overall, which is better for future prospects?

It is well-known for its business school, and so graduating with the BA and a minor from that college could even add to my degree, potentially more value than ABET -- this is what I need to clarify.

Do graduate schools outside the US care about ABET accreditation? How about hiring committees? Do they give a damn about B.A. versus B.S.?

JPMC pays $60/hr + $2500 lump sum

csMajors,"I did my undergrad in Mathematics and Stats, did a small amount of programming but it was more focused on data analysis and numerical approximation as opposed to learning data structures/computer architecture. So no real experience in building applications etc that I company would actually be interested in.

So I'm hoping to go to grad school and do a masters in CS. I know people say it's not necessary but I've been trying for two years to get a job in SWE, I've gotten to advanced stages few times but no offers. Also I do want to actually study Computer Science, not just interested in coding. So would enjoy really studying CS intensely and becoming competent at it beyond just learning how to code.

So I'm trying to choose between US and Europe for grad school. Europe is a lot cheaper but they seem very strict on prerequisites. I have all the Math classes but I'm usually short on just one or two prerequisites, typically Algorithms and Data Structures. I have asked at several institutions, some have said they don't give opinions on potential suitability and just refer to prerequisites page. I had one German university actually suggest I go back and complete a bachelors in CS to qualify as without the prerequisite CS classes I would not be eligible. Seems crazy just for two classes. My undergrad university doesn't offer option to just go back and do one or two classes for situations like this.

US institutions are a lot more accommodating. I'm sure the top programs may not accept me but I've had several positive replies from accredited schools saying my math background is enough. 

So my dilemma is that European universities would charge me at most 5-10k but in many cases zero for tuition but they are very strict on entrance requirements, obviously they are not as focused on making money and filing out courses. I'd also have quite a good chance of making it into a top school in the Math Department so I think with right approach I could get into a top CS department or maybe stats/data science with a lot of CS in the course.

Where as US colleges are a lot more accommodating but the fees are astronomical in comparison and I can't help feel they are just saying anything as they are more focused on the business element of it.

Can anyone advise on my options? ideally I'd study in Europe so I can save on fees and have a chance at top ranked school,  but need one that would accept me without CS credits. Or maybe US institution where I could do it for low fees?

I don't have any SWE experience, but I do know data structures and algorithms with Java/C being my preferred languages. I'm not amazing at LC, and I realize I probably need to put in more work. However, I am seeing friends/classmates getting SWE offers (FAANG included) who are graduating early in 2024 (3 years) without any experience, while I am graduating in 2025 and not landing at least a single interview or follow-up from a recruiter. I really want to work as SWE but worst-case try for IT opportunities.

Now I feel a bit conflicted. I wonder if I should have just lied and wrote that I was graduating in 2024 instead of 2025. I've been almost completely honest as to what I know in terms of languages and knowledge, and perhaps that is the wrong approach. 

I've been told that my aspirations for SWE are one-dimensional and I should move on from Java/C to Python and explore fields like DS/AI/ML. I'm not a fan of Python/scripting languages compared to compiled/functional languages and am in denial of its utility but learning the hard truth especially from anonymous people probably will change my mind.

How should I improve my chances for next year? Everyone says to just LC but initially I planned to take harder courses such as higher level algos, compilers, OS, networks, etc. Should I just take easier classes so that I have more time to LC/grind personal projects?

I live in Sweden and I've gone through 3/10 semsters of our ""psychologist programme"" (which is a specific uni ""programme"", basically a combined bachelors + masters in psychology). I'm thinking of switching to CS, for a number of reasons. 

I'm planning to begin a bachelor's in CS the fall of 2023, and thereafter a major in CS, to be finished in 2028 (When I'm 27, is this late?)

But, since I've gone through 3/10 of the psychologist programme, I can maybe go through 3/10 more and get a bachelor's in psychology, or continue the full 10 semesters, and get a master's in psychology. 

This would mean studying cs and psychology simultaneously for 1-3 years (1 if bachelor's in psychology, 3 if master's). 

How attractive would I be on the job market in Silicon Valley, L.A., etc.? Would the psychology bachelor's/master's be overlooked completely, or not considered to contribute much additional value? I'd like to make at least $150k upon graduating, which seems reasonable by holding a CS master's alone.

csMajors,"I think I would care most about cost of living (taxes, rent, etc), safety, social life (if there's other young ppl present), diversity (since im Asian), food and outdoors. I am less into nightlife and etc. Comp is decent for these locations. I am restricted to working remotely from these locations due to some rando reasons the company created, but I don't think I will stay here for long. The other possible locations that are allowed are (all tier3): Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida (except Miami), Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont.  


**Factors to consider**:

Cost of living wise I think 2 Florida locations and Houston would be lowest, and Atlanta being the highest cost of living.

I am from upstate NY and having direct flights would be nice (hence why florida since we have flights going there directly for some reason).

csMajors,"Hello all, quick background: I'm a junior in college, I expect to graduate 12/23 with a BS in Informatics. I have accepted two different internships, one for the Spring (Dec-Apr) and the other for the Summer. I live in the capitol of my state and the spring internship is working for the state legislative branch's technology department as a 'Business Analyst Intern'. The Summer internship is with Infosys as a SWE intern (I am looking for other internships for the summer, but I immediately accepted to ensure I have something at the very least. They, as well as my state, are at-will so I will not be held responsible for reneging on the offer). I have other prospects I am currently pursuing (clearly I don't want to work for Infosys), but I am in different stages of the application process so I am still waiting. 

My questions are as follows:

Is the spring internship working fory states legislative branch's technology department as a business Analyst Intern a good role/be looked at positively?

Are government IT roles looked at as positive experience from other companies in the IT industry?

I've seen a lot said bout WITCH companies, is it really that bad?

Is it bad to have a WITCH job on your resume? What about if it's an internship as a SWE intern?

csMajors,"Hey everyone, got a system design interview coming up next week (Palantir decomp) and i just started prepping two days ago, so needless to say I’m pretty stressed. I’ve been reading grokking and watching YouTube vids, but I don’t really have a solid handle on how to put everything together for the interview if that makes sense - like I understand the concepts separately, but I’m struggling a bit with using them together in the right way

I’m not sure how deeply technical I need to get for these kind of interviews - for example, do you really need to do computations for storage and memory and make estimations about them? Is this generally expected? Because how do specific numbers affect your design, since in most cases you’re expected to have lots of users and need to scale up anyway?

Also, are you expected to know the names of specific softwares to use for your design? I’ve seen some explained on YouTube and wasn’t sure I’d need to know them or how they work

I’ve also seen quite a bit of detail on hashing (like md5, etc), but again is this something i need to understand more than just conceptually (consistent hashing and all)?

I only have a few days left to prep so I’m just trying to cram as much as I can, struggling quite a bit cuz the info is so new to me, so any advice would be super helpful - if anyone has any Palantir-specific advice as well that would be great, as I’ve heard mixed things about how technical the decomp interview is (some have said it’s very general and some have said they grill you on technical concepts lol)",System design interview tips?

csMajors,"Well, not to anyone. But just to people with one kind of specific personality. 

Back when I was in my last year of highschool, I was divided on what to study. The two options were physics and computer engineering. I wish I had chosen physics, but for me, computers were this obscure machines I couldn't figure out how they worked. This extreme curiosity, and a sincere interest in programming, computers and robotics since I was a kid, led me to choose computer engineering.

Now I'm at my last year. And don't get me wrong, I absolutely love what I have studied.
Now I understand how (almost) everything works, I've obtained very good grades and will probably have a good-paying job. Academically, I couldn't have chosen better, but not everything in life is earning money or getting good grades.

Now I realize I haven't had a happy, fulfilling student stage. 
All my highschool friends have made a lot of new good friends at university, they have partied a lot, they've had romantic interests, they've done a lot of crazy stuff. Sometimes I go to their universities with their friends, and It's  just something different. The vibes are so different in every other studying field.
I'm a very social, extroverted person (easy-going, I think) and I haven't managed to make friends at computer science school.

It just has something to do with the people who study computer science. They are mostly very introverted people who don't want to party or make new friends. And that's completely OK, everyone is different, but most people, like me, need to socialize much more. Every student association at my uni is to watch anime or play videogames, I don't enjoy any of those things. And most of the time, I'm not able to have a conversation with anyone about something not related to computers.
As I say, I don't blame them, everyone has a different personality. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just that I need something else in my life, and I feel the majority of the population too.

That's why I won't recommend studying computer science: not for the field or knowledge itself, but for what it is surrounded by. It's depressing for me.

I want to know if your experience has been the same. Maybe in other countries it's different, who knows.

csMajors,"Hi there. I have a learning disorder and I've realized that the way that CS is usually taught is really hard for me to understand because of the way my brain works.

For example, I was able to easily learn concepts presented in Cory Doctorow's novels that related to cybersecurity or economics, like how public-key cryptography works. But when I try to read books on the concepts and languages I want to learn, or I try to work on projects that I'm interested in, I get really frustrated because I just can't understand the context and application of what I'm trying to figure out.

I coded a java version of the insertion sort algorithm a while back and recently I was reading through some other online implementations when I came across this website: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-insertion-sort-and-selection-sort/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-insertion-sort-and-selection-sort/) that claims the number of comparison operations performed for insertion sort is less than the number of swaps performed, and I'm confused as to how this is possible. Shouldn't the number of comparison operations performed usually be greater than the number of swaps because there will be some cases where elements are compared but a swap isn't made?

csMajors,"It's Thanksgiving, right? Time to give thanks in a reflection!

I didn't know who to discuss this with and thought it would be unfair to waste a friend's Thanksgiving weekend with a jumble of words that may not even make sense. So, I decided to leave this post on a subreddit full of Computer Science majors, perhaps in an attempt to unravel my emotions and reflect upon the previous three years, the upcoming future, and convey a message that I hope others may internalize and wield to their benefit in the future.

Currently, I am a Junior CS student at a mediocre university - probably obvious given that this post exists on r/csMajors. I signed my offer to become a Google SWE Intern in the Summer of 2023, marking this as my 4th and final undergraduate internship. 

If I had told the highschool me that I would have landed 4 internships in big tech, I would immediately call myself a liar, who wouldn't? I remember as a freshman, I haphazardly sent out one internship application, repeatedly telling myself that there was no way that application would amount to anything, that I was wasting ANY recruiter's time. After all, I had no experience, no projects, was proficient in only one programming language (Java), and hadn't even taken a Data Structures course. 

Despite that fact, I was already doing LeetCode in my free time, but not for interview preparation - I genuinely found the ""Hard"" problems to be challenging, fulfilling my desire to indulge in a sea of thought and wondrous ideas.

To be honest, I singlehandedly attribute all the time that I put into these problems to allowing me to land all the internships I had. I could not be more grateful for this - although the importance of projects cannot be understated, I believe that luck also plays a significant role in the first internship you land. After all, what even are the chances that a completely inexperienced freshman from a non-target gets an interview from a FAANG, and proceeds to ace it only because he loves the process of problem-solving? It seems like something out of a fantasy, really. Completely unfair.

After that first internship, surely enough, the gates were opened. What I don't understand is how I got all those interviews. Amazon, Citadel, Duolingo, Hudson River Trading, Databricks, D.E. Shaw, Optiver, Akuna Capital, the list continues. This world is strange, and it makes me truly question what makes a resume impressive. Definitely not what my resume was.

Why do I say this? When I applied to these companies as a Sophomore, I had 0 meaningful projects on my resume, was only proficient in Java &amp; C++, and had one internship. I had a good GPA, but I really didn't think that mattered given I was only a Sophomore and hadn't really taken the core CS classes.

Nowadays, I still wonder if I deserved any of the internships I had landed. Embarrassingly, I still have no meaningful projects on my resume, just some programming competition accolades, and somehow, miraculously, three internships. The luck cannot be more apparent.

I still feel like I suck at writing industry code.

I still feel like I know little to nothing about Computer Science.

I still feel like I am not passionate about Computer Science.

I still feel like the past 3 years have been a waste. They clearly weren't from a logical standpoint, but I can't shrug off the feeling that those 3 years could have been spent doing something else, perhaps pursuing another major that allows me to indulge in other interesting problems.

At the end of the day, the question I always find myself asking is, ""what did you do all of this for?""

Today, my answer to this question is, ""to determine whether Software Engineering aligns with my passions"". I still don't know if I am a good Software Engineer, or if I will pursue another field in the future. I still feel particularly incompetent when I compare myself to my peers, but what if those peers feel the same way about me? Perhaps imposter syndrome effortlessly perpetuates among the qualified, and withers among the unqualified. I definitely do not believe I am qualified, but regardless of the truth to this matter, the facts say I have 4 CS internships.

It is honestly crazy to fathom that so much could happen in the span of 3 years. To say that time has the tendency to speed up as you age is no joke - cliché, but it still feels that it was only a week ago that I sent out my first internship, and landed it yesterday. Who knows what tomorrow will bring, but to say that the past three years have been unpredictable cannot be more accurate.

Life is crazy, and you never know how reality will unravel after you shoot your shots. Live for the unexpected!

csMajors,"This guide consists of several subsections: my background, introductory steps, practice resources, study resources, practice methods, and answering common questions about competitive programming.

**My Background and Disclaimers:**

A quick disclaimer: I am not some genius competitive programmer. In fact, I consider myself to be beginner/intermediate, given that I have been doing it for &lt; 10 months in total now (not continuously - I stopped for a year and a half in between, doing no programming during this time). So, by no means am I an expert on this topic - if anyone feels like I have missed something in this guide (which I certainly have), do leave a comment! That being said, I think that I'm a good person to be writing this guide because **when I started competitive programming, I had zero knowledge of programming and virtually no math background.** Many successful competitive programmers you will come across have been coding from a young age and/or doing math competitions (e.g., IMO) for years prior to starting, and so trying to follow what they did to ""get good"" will probably just not work for you (unless you share such a background).

But chances are, if you are reading this, you know some programming and/or math, and so pretty much everything I mention here will be either applicable to you or beneath you (so to speak). I guess I should prove that these techniques worked for me - using them, I was able to go from zero to Google Kickstart top 50, winning prizes, placing first/second nationally in big competitions, ICPC, etc. in not too long. (Not tying to flex at all - actually, my achievements aren't anything impressive compared to other competitive programmers - it's just that these sort of posts usually contain something like this)

Another disclaimer: **I do not mention USACO anywhere in this blog**. The reason: I simply have never used it. I have heard some excellent things about it, though, so if anyone would like to add USACO-specific comments, please do!

**So, how do I start? And what is competitive programming?**

Before you read any further, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVKHRtafgPc) from William Lin if you haven't already. It's great at answering questions you may have, and William also goes over his tips for beginners. So what's the purpose of this post then? Well, the video is a bit outdated in my opinion - I have some stuff to add. Also, William can be classed as one of those ""competitive programming geniuses"" I mentioned earlier. There is also this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAeiXy8-9Y8), by another YouTuber called Errichto, that I also recommend.

After you've watched the video(s), there's one thing I want to add right off the bat - **don't focus on typing speed** as a beginner. It's simply not important if you're starting out - solving problems is much, much more worth your time at this stage, in my opinion. There are Legendary Grandmasters (LGMs on Codeforces - more on this platform later) who type with two fingers, after all. I am not going to elaborate more on what competitive programming is, what big competitive programming contests there are, etc. as these are all either Google-able questions or have been answered in the videos linked above. As for my thoughts on how to start competitive programming, keep reading...

**Practice Resources**

Let's now get into resources you can use to practice (ie solve problems). Interestingly, everyone says the same thing - **when you start off, it does not matter what resource you use**. At the beginning, you are still developing basic competences and learning basic techniques, and so the platform you use  doesn't matter as long as its a decent one (and one with easy problems, of course). William mentions Hackerrank in his video. Other people use HackerEarth, Codechef, ƒor LeetCode even.

But I want to talk a bit about the two platforms that have helped me the most (and probably the two biggest platforms at the moment) - Codeforces and AtCoder. I am sure many of you have heard of Codeforces, and what William says about it and how to use it is great. So, I will speak about AtCoder in more depth - I think it is a brilliant platform. The great thing about it is it's **immediately accessible**. Yes, you, reading this, if you know just a tiny bit of a programming language, you can go the [AtCoder website](https://atcoder.jp/), pick an ABC (AtCoder Beginner Contest), and have a good shot at solving the first two problems, which are designed to be accessible to everyone. If you can't, read the editorial. Rinse and repeat (more about this method is to come in the ""How to Practice"" section), solving all problems that you can each time, and you'll quickly see improvement. 

Once ABCs become too easy, move onto ARCs (AtCoder Regular Contests), and then to AGCs. Of course, just like Codeforces, these contests are hosted by AtCoder - meaning you can compete in them! And just like that, you can rapidly improve at competitive programming without even really realising it, and even enjoying the competitive aspect of it. **Note** that you can also use Codeforces in a similar way, but I particularly like that AtCoder has very easy problems to allow people with no experience to dive straight into competitive programming.

There are many other online judges (websites you can solve problems, submit code, and get instant feedback), such as DMOJ, SPOJ, and Kattis. These sites have a variety of problems and also often allow you to sort problems by difficulty/number of solves, as William demonstrates in his video with Codeforces. You can try them all out, see which problems you like the most perhaps, but I recommend sticking to one when you're starting out. For example, many Japanese competitive programmers have only used AtCoder in their competitive programming journey.

**Study Resources**

Great - now we know about many platforms that exist for you to solve problems/compete on, and we also have a rough idea of a solid practice routine. However, there is one key aspect of competitive programming that deserves to be explored in more depth: how to learn new concepts. As you improve, you will very quickly come across unfamiliar topics, and it's essential that you tackle that unfamiliarity in a suitable manner - when you come across a DFS problem for the first time, should you buy a book on Graph Theory and spend a month learning it all? Obviously not. I am now going to share some resources for studying (or more accurately, learning) and what you *should* do in such a situation.

There is one learning resource that stands out above the rest, in my opinion. It is the Competitive Programmer's Handbook, by CSES - [link](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf). It is completely free, and covers pretty much everything any beginner/intermediate competitive programmer needs to know. It includes implementations and proofs, as well explanations of the intuition behind solutions. I cannot recommend this enough. Take our situation from earlier - when you come across the term DFS, simply look it up in the handbook, read the section, and you're done! (You'll also want to solve some problems on it to test/refine your understanding - more on this later) Another great thing about this resource is that it goes through topics in a good order. So, you can literally just read through it, if you so desire. There are, of course, other great resources to improve your competitive programming knowledge - one of which being, as you might expect, YouTube videos. 

[Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/@Errichto), who I have mentioned already, makes fantastic educational videos. He made an entire series on Dynamic Programming, a fundamental concept, which helped me enormously. [SecondThread](https://www.youtube.com/@SecondThread) has also made some great beginner-level content, and I personally enjoy [Algorithms Live](https://www.youtube.com/@AlgorithmsLive)'s videos (but they may be a bit less accessible to newbies). 

There's another amazing resource I want to highlight that goes hand-in-hand with the previous paragraph, and that is Codeforces blogs. Codeforces, which is indeed a contest-hosting platform, is also the largest *community* of competitive programmers in the world. If you come across a topic/technique you want to learn, just add ""codeforces"" to your Google search, and it's likely several resource list/tutorial blogs will come up.

For example, say I have tried to solve a problem for a while, and gave up. I read the editorial, which mentions using the ""*Convex Hull Trick for Dynamic Programming*"". I think to myself, what on earth is that? Many people of my rating solved this problem, so I should really be ale to solve it myself! Let me go learn it! All I have to do is search up ""*convex hull trick codeforces*"" in Google - and bam, there are pages of search results with tons of useful material *specifically* about using this trick in competitive programming (see for yourself!). I can even search up ""*convex hull trick* ***problems*** *codeforces***""** \- clicking on the very first Codeforces blog that comes up, and scrolling down, I see a whole bunch of previously seen competitive programming problems linked that I can use to practice *this very technique*. And bear in mind, this specific algorithm is *not at all a beginner topic!* Imagine if it was an easier topic that I was searching for!

There's one final resource which I'd briefly like to touch on, that you could say I have a bias for. It's a textbook used in MIT and several other institutions, known as Introduction to Algorithms. Its authors have initials C, L, R and S, and thus is often also called CLRS. Interestingly, it's additionally known as The Bible, which should already indicate how great of a resource it is! I like it because not only does it describe algorithms and provide implementations, but proves correctness and explains the mathematics underlying them. Objectively though, it is **massive overkill** for competitive programming - it's over a thousand pages long, and if you buy it, like I did, it will set you back quite a bit. The reason I wanted to mention it is that it's a superb resource if you are interested in algorithms/problem solving/math in general, and I can say with confidence that even if I hadn't persisted with competitive programming, it'd still be worth every penny.

**How to Practice/Improve**

OK, let's now formalise a practice routine, and start to bring everything together. I, and many others, recommend the following - solve problems that are slightly challenging for you (say, 0 - 200 points above your rating on Codeforces) (using the **Practice Resources**). When you are starting out, if you cannot solve a problem within, say, twenty minutes - stop (there's a good chance a technique is required that you are not familiar with). Then, read the editorial, go learn the technique (using the **Study Resources**) and solve problems on that technique, if it uses a technique you don't know. If it doesn't, fully digest the editorial, understand the logic behind it, and **up-solve the problem**. This (in most cases) means to solve a problem you couldn't solve after reading (some or all of) its solution, and is crucial, especially when you are starting out and lack implementation skills. 

There's another similar technique, that I have heard that Grandmaster use - simply pick a problem difficulty (e.g., 200 points above your current Codeforces rating), filter all problems down to those corresponding to that difficulty, and solve all of them, reading editorials, learning and up-solving where you see fit. Then, compete in contests to get to that rating, and repeat the process. **Note** however that you should not follow this exact method if you are a beginner, because there will simply be too many problems of a low difficulty for you to solve them all!

Now, there's one key point here that I've just sort of skimmed over - competition! It is competitive programming, after all. If contests didn't exist, what would be the point? Platforms like Codechef, Codeforces and AtCoder hold contests and have a rating system, which is a HUGE motivator to improve and practice. If you're starting out, for example, set yourself the following challenge - every time you compete in an AtCoder contest, try and to better (get a higher rank) than the last contest. Alternatively, if you have friends that do competitive programming, try and get to a higher rating than them! Or, challenge yourself to get to, say Expert, or Candidate Master, or even Specialist/Pupil (if you're just starting out) on Codeforces! Simply competing in contests, then up-solving the problems you didn't solve, is yet another excellent practice routine, which often doesn't even feel like practice at all. In fact, as I touched on earlier, because of the accessibility of AtCoder Beginner Contests, you can solely use this practice method with ABCs, which can make the process interesting and enjoyable. Note that **virtual participation** is a thing - essentially, you can compete in a contest you haven't done before *as if you were in the contest itself*. It's supported on Codeforces and AtCoder, and probably more platforms. Thus, if there is no ongoing contest or you don't want to risk losing rating, you can still ""compete"".

There's one final practice/improvement resource that can really deepen your understanding of theory, and allow you to solve more/harder problems. This is the [CSES problem set](https://cses.fi/problemset/). The astute among you will realise that CSES has already been mentioned - they made the handbook! This problem set goes hand-in-hand with it, actually, and provides practice problems for the topics mentioned in the book! This way, when you read a section of the book, you can solve problems on it, and be better prepared when problems on those topics come up in contests.

**An anecdote about improvement and practice:**

So far, I've sort of just thrown information and practice methods at you. I'm now going to explain how I overcame a big hurdle that was preventing me from improving, to show how the methods I've described can apply to your journey.

As I mentioned at the very beginning of this post, I started competitive programming with very little CS/math background knowledge. I started solving problems and gaining rating, which was great. I was really drawn to the more programming-y problems, involving greedy algorithms, DP, graphs, data structures, etc.., and so solved a lot of problems on these topics. However, I soon realised something - I was terrible at math problems. Math is very important in competitive programming - specific areas of math, to be more accurate, as William Lin explains in his video. I would constantly come across low-rated (easy) problems that I would really struggle with simply because they were math. This was a huge problem for me, and cost me a lot of rating points. It got to the point where I was able to implement Segment Trees, but did not know about the Triangle Inequality (yes, when I said I had virtually no math background, I was not joking!). 

So, when I had some free time, I simply did the following - pretty much every day, for nearly two weeks, I would pick a random AtCoder Beginner Contest I hadn't done before (note, there is a great [website](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder) that lets you see which problems you haven't solved), and force myself to solve until Problem F. Note that I did this because **AtCoder is an extremely mathematical programming platform**. It is not at all uncommon for an AtCoder problem statement to simply be ""Evaluate this function"", followed by some long math expression.

While doing the contest, If I couldn't solve a problem after an hour of thinking (sometimes, I gave myself up to 3 hours for the Fs), only then would I read the editorial, and even then, I would make sure I understood it, no matter how long it took. If it was a topic, such a combinatorial technique I wasn't familiar with, I would use the **Study Resources** I've described earlier to learn it, then up-solve the problem after. After doing this for a couple of weeks, I was amazingly no longer terrible at math! Interestingly, now, some of my strongest topics are math-related, something I would have never dreamt of. Even more interestingly, months after doing this ""training"" (if you can call it that), I saw a Codeforces [blog post](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/103077), where the author, a Grandmaster, explained that he used almost an identical method to improve at math problems!

**I will now go over some commonly asked questions, and my responses to them.**

**1) Do I need to study DSA beforehand?**

The short answer: no. Solve problems, learn the DSA stuff when you come across a problem that requires it, and then solve problems on that topic (a recurring theme in this post!). This prevents you from spending hours trying to understand a DS/A you are just too inexperienced to understand.

Of course, if you are interested in DSA in general, feel free - it won't hurt, of course, and can only help your future self. But, for sure, if you dive right in, you will soon come across a beginner-level DSA concept, such as prefix sums or binary search while solving problems. And so, you will inadvertently be learning DSA at a pace that suits you!

**2) What programming language to learn?**

Now, this is a lot more controversial. I don't think there is a right answer. Objectively, C++ is the best. Its standard library, speed, paired with the simple fact that most competitive programmers use it, makes it unparalleled. But is it worth going out of your way to learn a new language just for competitive programming? Or is it worth learning such a hard language from scratch? Honestly, it's up to you. If you're just starting out, you can just use the language you know best. Often, competitive programmers start with Java or Python, and later switch to C++. So, the choice you make now isn't all too important.

Do your research on your language of choice - if it is semi-popular (e.g. Java, Python), think well before going out of your way to learn a new one (although, as mentioned earlier, you don't need that much C++ for competitive programming). If you don't know any language, I'd say go with C++ - you can be confident it will serve you well and you won't have to ever switch in the future. But, those are just my two cents - there are probably hundreds of blogs/videos about this question, maybe check out others' POV before making a decision on what language to learn.

As a final note, Python is often considered far worse than C++ and Java for competitive programming, but a [Python programmer](https://codeforces.com/profile/conqueror_of_tourist) has recently become a LGM on Codeforces. Probably though, choose a language from these three (they are by far the most popular), but which one you choose among them is not nearly as important as your ability to solve problems - I think everyone will agree with me on that.

**3) (I've decided to learn / I'm considering learning) C++, but I don't know anything right now.**   
**How should I learn it?**

This is an extremely pertinent question, that I think I am capable of answering well given that I knew no programming (let alone C++) before doing competitive programming.

My main response may seem counter-intuitive: **DO NOT BUY A C++ BOOK/COURSE**. The C++ that is required for competitive programming is a very specific **subset** of the language itself. For example, **not once have I EVER had to even think about memory management in competitive programming**. Also, **not once have I EVER had to use inheritance or similar OOP concepts in competitive programming**. All C++ programmers appreciate how crucial memory management and OOP is to the language, and for sure, any good book or course you take **will** go into those two aspects, most likely in some depth. This will be **almost completely useless** to you in competitive programming - it's simply not worth your money. To give yet another example, I was watching one of the best competitive programmers in the world stream, and they mentioned that **they do not understand pointers and references in C++**. So, you don't even really need to understand what a pointer is for competitive programming, but it is imperative that you have a deep understanding of the algorithmic parts of the STL? Good luck finding a course/book that follows such a layout! 

Of course, you can pick and choose the parts that you think are relevant, but I instead recommend a different way of learning the language, and this is what I did. First off, learn the basics. Learn how functions work, what the main function is, variables, types, etc. In fact, most of you reading this post will already know all of this. But if you don't, (and even if you do, just to be sure) find a YouTube video/beginner-level course that explains the absolute basics. I am not going to go in any more depth on how to learn basic C++, as I am sure there are hundreds of resources on this topic.

Once you know some of the basics, I'd say also read some of the handbook (as you've probably realised, I'm a huge fan of this resource), which will also teach you some essential features of the language required for competitive programming (STL, overflow, etc). During this time, you can also start solving problems. As you solve problems, make sure to **look at the top competitors' code/editorial code**, as doing so will gradually expose you to the C++ features required for competitive programming. For example, you may look at the top seed's code on a sorting problem and see how they sorted a vector in non-ascending order, or how they were able to specify a sorting comparator, or how they used a *struct* to represent a certain DS. If you don't understand a specific function or container, for example, Google it/look at the reference docs. Once again, we see the common theme of learning a certain aspect as of when you need it, which I am a big fan of as it prevents you from learning useless information. (Of course, if you are interested in learning C++ in general, do indeed buy a book/course and learn stuff you want to learn about - in this response, I am primarily addressing those who want to learn C++ *solely* to use for competitive programming.)

If you are struggling with writing C++ or implementation, it goes without saying that you should practice writing C++ and implementation! I found it helpful to pick some easy competitive programming problems, and try to solve them as quickly as I could. This definitely improved my command of the language and my ability to implement solutions quickly, both of which are essential to competitive programming.

**Final Notes**

Firstly, I'd like to quickly give a shout-out to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/yvgor9/guide_how_to_actually_get_good_at_leetcode/), which inspired me to write this one.

Secondly, please note that there are several posts just like this one which you find useful. You can find ones written by top competitive programmers, such as [this one](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/53341),  [this one](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/91114),  or [this one](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/98806), and also ones written by more ""average"" competitive programmers, on Codeforces. It may be that you share a more similar background with others than you do with me, and so learning about their journeys and practice routines might be more useful.

Thirdly, there was actually another question that I had planned to answer, ""Why should I even do/persist with competitive programming? "", but this post is already long enough as it is. If anyone is interested, I can certainly write another post with my thoughts on this question.

One final thing - **please leave any questions/comments you may have** ***on this post,*** **instead of PM-ing me about it**! That way, others will also be able to see/respond.

If you've made it this far, thank you for reading! I realise this post is extremely unorganised; I apologise for this, and for any grammatical errors I have undoubtedly made. Hopefully, you were still able to take away something of value :).",A Guide to Competitive Programming

There's a couple of these posts already up, but I want to make a post that isn't just humble bragging. Also I stole this format lol.

To get it out the way, I accepted an offer with Microsoft in NYC for summer 2023.

#  Background:

**Education:** Junior at a t50 school (t20 cs program) majoring in mathematics. I took the intro cs track as a freshman.

**Experience:** 2 Internships at Google, 1 at Nasa, and a couple of volunteerships with local tech nonprofits.

**Projects:** None, lol

If anyone wants my resume, lmk and I can post an anonymous one. But its literally just Jake's Resume.

# Statistics:

I applied to \~100 internships, got like 20 OAs, received 10 interview invites, and 2 offers

**Leetcode:** 53 easies, 15 mediums, 0 hards (to be fair I did a ton on [binarysearch.com](https://binarysearch.com) before that site closed down)

**Codesignal:** 750(ish)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to be very clear as to what each company asked of me and how long the processes were.

&amp;#x200B;

# company that I cant type out

**Position:** SDE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 09/21, interview/oa invite 10/04, interviews 10/24, waitlisted (lol) 11/15

**Thoughts:** Hated the process, and it increasingly became clear after \[redacted\] started freezing hiring and laying people off that I wouldnt get an offer no matter how well I did. Recruiters were not transparent about hiring freezes. 

My interviewer, however, was real about the fact that I probably wouldnt get hired due to the freezes so W interviewer.

**Technical Interview:** He asked me invert binary tree and grilled me on java stack/heap

&amp;#x200B;

# Klaviyo

Got this interview from a campus job fair

**Position:** SWE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 09/28, interview invite 09/29, interviews 10/01 and 10/12, rejected 10/14

**Thoughts:** I appreciated how quick and blunt the process was. I was kinda burned that I went through 4 hours of interviews for an automated rejection lol, but thats life. Interviews were fine tho.

**Technical Interview:** Altogether I had 3 technical rounds.

\- First and second round they asked questions that involved me learning and applying json and react knowledge on the spot. If you interview for this company, you should learn json and react in python lol.

\- Third interview asked me to break down nested json data. The solution was a recursive method.

&amp;#x200B;

# Squarespace

**Position:** SWE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 10/03, interview/oa invite 10/03, interviews 10/20, rejected 10/24

**Thoughts:**  Process was quick as hell, super transparent

**Technical Interview:** I was asked to implement a tiktok algorithm similar to my OA. The solution was to implement a doubly-linked list using a hashmap in order to make every needed operation in constant time complexity. I needed alot of hints to get to this point, so its understandable that I was rejected lol. 

System Design round, I was asked to design a blog site.

&amp;#x200B;

# Netflix (In process)

**Position:** SWE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 10/08, interview/oa invite 10/21, interviews 11/09 - 12/??

**Thoughts:** There are 3 rounds to the Netflix SWE internship, 1 is technical, 1 is system design, 1 is behavioral w a hiring manager. The technical portion was easier that I thought, and I passed it and moved on to system design. My interviewer told me that the intern program next summer would be fully fledged, including intern events and return offers(?).

**Technical Interview:** I got a Shortest Path in Maze problem. I used dfs to get a working solution (they make you run your code), and he asked me a couple of extensions that, if you understand the general dfs solution, were pretty ez. If you study the blind 75 easies/meds, youll be fine.

I have yet to do the system design portion.

&amp;#x200B;

# D.E Shaw

**Position:**  Systems: Technologist Intern 

**Timeline:** Applied 09/25, interview invite 10/06, interview 10/13, rejected 10/27

**Thoughts:** God damn they took a while to reject me lol

**Technical Interview:** They grilled me on the networking portions of my resume (I did a CISCO routing/switching magnet program in hs, did like 1 internship out of it), and quizzed me on tcp vs udp, java garbage collection, and handling large amounts of data

&amp;#x200B;

# BNY Mellon

**Position:**  START dev intern

**Timeline:** Applied 10/03, interview invite 10/19, interview 10/26, verbal offer 10/31

**Thoughts:** simple process, oa and technical were relatively ez

**Technical Interview:** They asked me to verbally solve two sum, and asked me surface level questions on oop fundamentals and data structures. Also asked to explain recursion and edge cases to someone who wasnt in tech.

&amp;#x200B;

# Microsoft

**Position:**  SWE Intern

**Timeline:** Applied 09/22, phone screen invite 09/26, final interview 11/02, portal update w offer 11/17

**Thoughts:** It took so. damn. long. to get an offer. Worth it doe. 

My first technical interviewer was 30min late, and I had to email my recruiter to get him on the phone (apparently his teams link wasnt working, which is honestly fair lol).

ALSO, I was kept in the dark for a while in between interviews. I emailed my recruiters twice after my final rounds and the only update I got was 2 weeks later via the portal. I had to email my recruiters for a bit to actually get a phone call to discuss the offer. I got the feeling that MSFT recruiters are overworked though, so all in all I appreciate them.

I was surprised to learn that I went thru team matching after my phone screen and that my final interviewers were my potential team managers lol.

**Technical Interviews:** For the phone screen, I got grilled on multithreading/processes, recursion, and OOP.

For the final technicals, I got grilled on java memory management by the guy who was 30min late (he was nice about it tho), and the second interviewer gave me valid anagram via codility. I couldnt figure out how to work the ide to make my code run, but she told me that my code looked perfect and they I impressed her. She was actually super nice, and we talked about wlb at microsoft vs twitter and her work on netflix ad servers.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This season was brutal, even with a decent resume. I suck at leetcode and failed so many OAs and interviews. I'm grateful to have gotten Microsoft, and if you dont have an offer yet, the recruiting season is far from over.

If I had to give some crucial tips:

* Use Jake's Resume format, oh my god. It's meta. If ur not using it, ur resume is (probably) ugly.
* Its a numbers game. Use the pitt github internship list and apply to every listing possible. 
* Blind 75 is (mostly) all you need tbh, dont stress too much on lc. This is probably a hot take lol.
* Alot of companies don't use leetcode! They expect you to be able to learn practical frameworks on the fly and solve problems with them in interviews. Which, imo, is harder than leetcode. So.. get good at that.
* Most of you guys on r/csMajors and blind are fucking insufferable lmao. Go outside!! TC and FAANG aren't everything. These companies care little about you, and the purpose of the job hunt is to get a comfy salary so you can live your life with a good financial base. If you're on here asking what to do with your life after getting a decent offer, you need to reflect..

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this post proves useful to people interviewing at these companies who need interview prep.

The post and comments were divided between humblebragging and despondent resentment over a reddittor's tale of humble victory in interviewing the biggest names in Big Tech. At one point, as the aggro grew, OP dissed someone for their tier 2, top 0.1% job, compared to his own multiple tier 1, top 0.01% offers.

Yawn.

Except: it looks like so many of you are building your identities, your sense of purpose and definitions of career success, by whether you can pass a horrible and narrow selection process to land a job in a massive corporation and make at least 6 figures, or be condemned to Looserland.

This is depressing to watch, must be even more depressing to live! 

You have, and are honing, a fantastically powerful set of skills. You get to build the very fabric of our civilisation, for good and for I'll. You get more chances at good jobs (more on that next), than the vast, vast majority of humanity, even I'm rich countries. 

But you choose to define a ""good job"" as a zero sum game to get into a tiny number of companies which may in fact be a terrible, terrible fit for you personally. Or a great fit, but not as good as another. Or a superb, exceptional fit: but not the only one available. 

Pause. Take your eye off the telescope. Look around. There are sooooo many cool companies out there. Some are big,  some are tiny. Some are eventually going to be bought by Big Tech. Some will never even have a conversation with anyone from Big Tech. But they can offer you a chance for growth, for impact, for friendship, for quality of life, for reinvention, for diversity. These things matter a lot more than brand size!

Sure, money matters, it's nice and all. And yes, 99.9% of companies will pay you less than a top hedge fund. But have you considered the opportunity cost of that pay rise? Who will you NOT get to hang out with, learn from, as a result of spending most of your life in that space? What kind of friendships, learnings, insights might await you in less well paying but more personally aligned work? Sure you could do with 6 figures at 22. But do you need 6 figures? Will 6 figures be even healthy for you? 

I have worked in fintech. With really lovely people. In edutech. In health tech. In civic tech. I have consulted for Big Tech, and for grassroots communities. And I tell you: the wide, wide world outside big tech is messy, uneven, but so rich, so interesting, so varied. 

Literally no one cares past high school,  whether you're with the popular kids. It's a toxic motivation. The wrong reason to feel good about yourself. The wrong reason to feel bad about yourself.

Instead, my advice is: decide what kind of human being you want to be; what kind of genuine personal relationships you want to have; what kind of impact you want to have on the world. 

Measure yourself against THAT benchmark. And I guarantee, whether you get a Big Name interview and job or not, or you don't, will look like a MUCH smaller problem. There will be plenty of fantastic software engineering jobs that pay you decently,  and allow you to accomplish THAT benchmark, often in richer, better ways than a job in Big Tech. Even if no one on Reddit has heard of that company. Even if no one outside Mombaza, or Philly, or Mérida or Geneva or Hong Kong or Cairo has.

Be your best self. Be productive. Be happy. Be decent. Be financially secure. Be excited. Be useful. Be a good human. 

I promise you that building your self esteem along the above criteria will take you further, and if you are determined, resilient and creative, will give you professional success along the way, and even recognition. Whether that involves working in the richest 100 companies, or in the 100 million awesome companies you haven't heard of yet.",LPT from a greybeard to CS students: dump the toxic benchmark of Big Name recruitment.

This fall, I applied to over 40+ SWE opportunities and was rejected by literally all except only had one interview where I was rejected afterwards. google gave me a candidate questionnaire like over a month ago but have ghosted me since.

Of course, you miss all the shots that you don’t take. But you also miss most of the shots that you don’t aim towards the net.

You absolutely have to apply for many positions, ones you don’t want, and ones you aren’t qualified for.

I sent out 8 applications, and I spent 2 days working on each one — tailoring a resume specifically to that job while still being honest and humble. If you aren’t including cover letters you are telling companies that you don’t want the internship.

While I am extremely interested, I do not feel prepared for the technical interview(s) yet. What can I do in this case? I feel like saying that I need more time to prepare for the technical interview would put him off.

Any advice is much appreciated!",Contacted by Palantir
csMajors,"Figured I’d do one of these since I’ve seen a couple here and there. I also receive a lot of dms and it’s hard to respond to them all so maybe this will answer some questions.

Background:
CS major at T10 school, previous internships at Uber, AWS and Google. No cool projects or any of the sort. Just this URL shortener and Neural net I built for Mammography classification. 

Stats: 
Applied to Ill say maybe ~20-25 places and heard back from the ones below: 

Jane Street: interviewed super early like July or something. Aced the interview, the interviewers even said so but I didn’t get called back for the next round. Prolly my fault for interviewing so early. 

Applied Intuition: Didn’t do too good in this interview can’t lie. Offered a redo but nah I wasn’t feeling it anymore just took the L.

Bloomberg: interview process took like a week and a half. Then another week for the EM meet and then I got the offer after a further 5 days. Received the hardest question I’ve seen in my life. Interviewer even said he didn’t expect any code to be written that he wanted a discussion. 

Uber: interview process was super quick like a week and then I got the offer the following week. I had a sys design round which I wasn’t prepared for but luckily I had seen a couple exponent videos so I aced apparently. 2 LC hards lol. 

Two Sigma: Did the phone screen, aced got another round aced, then had an intermediary round before the final even though it was supposed to be phone then final ( I even have friends that did just final). Didn’t do good in this one. The question was simply too hard for me to think of a proper solution. I was on the right track and all nah. Took the L.

Amazon: got return offer

Google: didn’t get return offer due to “headcount constraints” and HC viewing my report as just okay. Was sent the whole PA form again and told that I would only have to do a single interview this year if I wanted to join but heavy pass on that. 

Pinterest: Aced first round, Pretty much aced the final but I didn’t get it lol. Was kinda surprised at first but it’s whatever saw it with Jane street. 

Netflix: did codesignal, heard back like 2 days later, aced the first round, completely aced the final and system design rounds and got the offer like 4 days after the final.

Exodus Point Capital: what a bunch of dickheads. Didn’t even have the decency to say why they weren’t going to turn on their cameras but expected me to turn on mine????? Didn’t allow me express my thought process or explain to them what I was doing just wanted to see my type code like a madman. When it was question time at the end. I asked the typical “tell me a little more, there much info publicly available” they said “we’re a hedge fund we make money”. What a douchebag.

DoorDash: decline the interview. I was tired. 

Atlassian:  did so well and even taught the interviewer a thing or two during the interview about DSAs in Java and the C++ STL. Didn’t get moved on. I wasn’t even tripping. They clearly didn’t have headcount and also couldn’t handle my salary demands.

Headlands: L after being sent the OA.

Rentech: YES RenTech lol wanted me to interview for a research engineering position in C++ but I was more interested in their Java infra position mainly cuz my C++ was rusty. I prolly should have just done the research interview because the waitlist for the infra one was long AF. 

Radix: took my data and never scheduled.


I think that should be it. If I remember anything else I’ll edit the post. I will add that I did bomb a lot of OAs either cuz they were hard as fuck or I just couldn’t finish in time. 

Morale of the story:
1. Know C++ don’t be like me. 
2. Watch exponent videos after gaurav sen on YouTube for system design. You’ll thank me.
3. Neetcode 150 and company tagged is more than enough. If you couldn’t solve it after all that, then well that question is for the codeforces generals.
4. Apply early, don’t wait. I prolly Ld out of some other places like Atlassian and Pinterest cuz of headcount. (I know this contradicts what I said about Jane Street)

csMajors,"Hi y'all! I am a freshman pursuing a computer science degree and have two offers for an internship. One internship is more of a SWE internship while the other seems to be leaning into cybersecurity. Looking at the job description of the cybersecurity one, there seem to be expectations that I haven't learned yet such as application protocols or security technologies. As a freshman just taken data structures and soon taking computer architecture, I myself have no idea what I want to do yet.

However, there is a chance I can work both internships. The SWE internships runs from May to August while the Cybersecurity internship runs from June to August. If I want to try both fields, I can work at the SWE internship in May, quit, and join the Cybersecurity internship from June to August. However, the risk with that is if I decide I liked/felt more experianced with the SWE internship but can't turn back. Also, I have no idea if good or bad implications would be made in the future if my resume shows I quite an internship midway through for another one.

csMajors," Hi csMajors!

I have found these types of posts very helpful during my internship hunt, so I decided to share my very own internship hunting journey this season. I hope that this will be helpful to shed some light onto what you can expect of the interviews of the mentioned companies or other companies in general! 

I was planning to dive into more details (wrote like 4,000 words lol but I think that is too risky and can be doxxed) for each of the application process, but I was wary of NDA-stuff so I am just going to provide the timeline for each and rate the difficulty of the process (behavioral, technical OA, technical interview, math if applicable) from 1 to 10, 1 being the easiest and 10 being the hardest. For example, a “1” behavioral question is like “Why us?” type of questions, and a 10 behavioral question is like “If you are put on Mars for a day, what kind of technology will you build (and with what tech stack and why), how would you choose your teammates, and how would you handle the conflicts with aliens?” type of questions. Likewise, a 1 technical question is like a fizzbuzz question, and a 10 technical question is like a leetcode DP hard question. Not the best way to shed light onto the application processes, but I will try my best (note that these are my personal experience, YMMV). For the offers, the compensation packages are the same as the ones listed on levels.fyi.

# Background:

**Education**: Junior majoring in honors math and CS at a T15 school (originally math, decided to add a second major in CS in sophomore year), not particularly known for its CS program. I have taken classes like discrete math, data structures, and software design along with quite a few upper-level math classes for my honors track.

**Experience**: 1 paid internship with a local startup in my home country (I’m international, so I do need sponsorship) that specializes in AI/ML products (I was on the NLP team), 1 unpaid internship with an organization that promotes the education of CS to young people (I was on the AI team with a bit of leadership responsibility), 1 paid research position at my university (leading a team that does computer vision research), 1 paid TA position at my university for 2 math classes.

**Projects**: 2 data analysis projects that revolved around video games (1 is a Discord bot, the other one was a deep learning model that I made from scratch), 1 fullstack app (a phone-calling app) using MERN, and 1 game/simulation that I made in Python. 

# Statistics:

For this season, I applied to around 200 internship programs, got around 20-30 OAs, had around 10 interview callbacks, and 8 “virtual” onsite interviews. In the end, I was able to get 5 offers. 

**Mandatory leetcode stats**: 124 easies, 217 medium, 18 hards, knight badge. I exclusively used Python for leetcode and interviews. I mostly used Neetcode to guide my prep.

**CodeSignal**: 843

I was able to get all test cases passed for all of my OAs.

&amp;#x200B;

Application process for companies that I got quite deeply into the process:

# Bank of America

**Position:** Global Quantitative Summer Analyst 

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (6/21) → video interview invitation via Hirevue (7/6) → complete video interview (7/9) → final round invitation (7/20) → superday interviews (7/27) → **offer** via email (8/12)

**Thoughts:** I was surprised at the interview process because it was almost entirely behavioral (with just a few soft technical questions about my projects during the superday). This was my first offer of the season, so I was ecstatic, and it had definitely helped boost my morale.

**Behavioral:** 6/10

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** 1/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Palantir

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online with referral (7/14) → Karat interview invitation (7/15) → Karat interview (7/21) → Karat interview redo (7/22) – virtual onsite invitation (8/1) → virtual onsite (8/11) → **rejection** via email (8/15)

**Thoughts:** This is one of the more “technical” interview processes that I had had so far, so I was pretty nervous. There was system design involved, and I was not fully prepared for it. It felt bad when I got rejected after being able to get to the onsite, but I had to learn to be numb to that feeling and try my best for my upcoming interviews.

**Behavioral:** N/A

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** 7/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Two Sigma

**Position:** Quantitative Researcher Intern

**Timeline:** Apply online without referral (6/28) → Hackerrank OA invitation (7/8) → OA completed (7/14) → data analysis interview invitation (8/5) → data analysis interview (8/18) → virtual onsite interview invitation (8/31) → virtual onsite interview (9/8) → **rejection** via email (9/8)

**Thoughts:** I was hoping that I can get a quant internship, so I was very nervous yet excited about this one, but I got grilled by the math questions. It was quite demoralizing and I regret not studying enough to be prepared for the core statistics, but at the same time, it made me realize the knowledge that I lack so that I can focus on studying them the next time around.

**Behavioral:** N/A

**Technical OA:** 6/10

**Technical Interview:** 5/10

**Math:** 10/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Amazon

**Position:** Software Development Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online with referral (6/24) → Hackerrank OA invitation (7/18) → OA completed (8/1) → virtual onsite invitation (8/2) → additional availability request (9/14) → virtual onsite interview (9/22) → portal updated (10/4) → **offer** via portal (10/5) 

**Thoughts:** Man, this was a wild ride. This is the only FAANG that I could get an interview from (I know, I know, it’s Amazon, but still) so I was very excited and did not want to let this slip away. I still remember frantically refreshing the portal and the reddit thread to check for any portal updates lol. Very proud of myself for this one since compensation is fantastic!

**Behavioral:** 7/10

**Technical OA:** 4/10

**Technical Interview:** 2/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Iron Galaxy Studios

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Career fair (9/22) → on-campus interview (9/23) → **ghosted**

**Thoughts:** This is one of the booths that I came to introduce myself during my school’s career fair, and the recruiter there was incredibly enthusiastic about the company! I did not plan to apply in the first place, but the recruiter’s incredible pitch about the company convinced me otherwise. Overall a unique and fun experience, but I never heard back from them.

**Behavioral:** 5/10

**Technical OA:** N/A

**Technical Interview:** N/A

&amp;#x200B;

# Goldman Sachs

**Position:** Summer Analyst, Engineering Division (Quantitative Strategies)

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (7/1) → Hackerrank OA invitation (7/5) → OA completed (7/12) → Hirevue interview invitation (9/2) → Hirevue completed (9/4) → virtual onsite interview invitation (9/21) → virtual onsite interview (9/28) → **offer** via phone call (10/7)

**Thoughts:** This is a rather lengthy process as the gap between the OA and the interviews were more than 2 months, but it was easy to navigate overall. Was definitely very excited to get the offer, since I felt like my math preparation had paid off and that I was at least somewhat prepared for quant roles.

**Behavioral:** 5/10

**Technical OA:** 3/10

**Technical Interview:** 4/10

**Math:** 6/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Roblox

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online with referral (8/4) → CodeSignal and Cognitive OA invitation (8/5) → both OA completed (8/19) → virtual onsite interview invitation (9/7) → virtual onsite interview rescheduled (9/30) → virtual onsite interview (10/17) → **offer** via phone call (10/20)

**Thoughts:** To be honest, this is a very streamlined and straightforward recruiting process (lowkey enjoyed the OA), although I did not prepare much for the onsite because I had already got Amazon at the time and was burnt out quite badly. Was quite surprised to get the offer, and the compensation as well as perks absolutely blew my mind!

**Behavioral:** 7/10

**Technical OA:** 5/10

**Technical Interview:** 7/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Hudson River Trading

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (8/3) → CodeSignal OA invitation (8/16) → interview invitation (10/20) → interview (11/9) → **rejection** via email (11/10)

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to get this one since I wanted to break into HFTs, so I spent a whole week going through OS and networking concepts without previous exposure to them. Got grilled hard in the interview, so rejection was expected. At least now my OS class next semester will be easier to deal with.

**Behavioral:** N/A

**Technical OA:** 5/10

**Technical Interview:** 11/10

&amp;#x200B;

# Tiktok

**Position:** Software Engineer Intern, Search Engine Team

**Timeline:** Applied online without referral (9/9) → Hackerrank OA invitation (9/30) → OA completed (10/7) → first interview invitation (10/13) → second interview invitation (10/17) → first interview (10/28) → second interview (11/7) → **offer** via phone call (11/23)

**Thoughts:** The interview was quite late into the season and I was busy preparing for HRT’s OS and networking interviews, so I did not prepare that much for Tiktok’s interviews. I didn’t think my interviews were good honestly and was not satisfied with my solutions, so I was really surprised that I got the offer.

**Behavioral:** 8/10

**Technical OA:** 10/10

**Technical Interview:** 6/10

&amp;#x200B;

Phew, what a crazy rollercoaster of emotions, especially after getting 400+ rejections last season without a single interview offer from U.S. companies! In the end, I have decided to go with **Roblox** for its amazing work culture, interesting projects and tech, great WLB, fun internship program, and incredible compensation/perks! 

Things that I have learned along the way:

* The hardest part is to pass the resume screening process. I have revised my resume many times, and I settled with a resume that uses Jake’s Resume template in LaTeX. Using a simple format like that allowed me to focus my time on buffing the meat of the resume (i.e. the textual content), not the layout or design. I used the STAR method, fancy words, and numerical metrics to make the bullet points stood out.
* Previous experience is not required, but it really helps tremendously. I populated my resume with positions that I could find within my university, and they really helped.
* Cover letters are pretty useless and a waste of time
* Referrals can help indeed, but without them I could still get far into the application processes, so don’t sweat them too much
* International students have it rough, but I wouldn’t let that kill my American Dream. Automatic rejections because of the sponsorship question happened a lot, but I tried to compensate for that with a well-crafted resume with relevant work experience and personal projects.
* Applying early (mid-late June) has been the biggest factor that helped, especially in this troubling economy since many companies like Amazon and Roblox had reached headcount earlier than usual
* Behavioral interview preparation is underrated. I spent a lot of time preparing for my behavioral interviews (I legit have 20 pages worth of notes for my behaviorals and I practiced them frequently in front of a mirror lol), and it surely made a difference especially when I am not the type of person that feel comfortable talking to new people
* Neetcode is an incredible teacher and leetcode mediums were my best friends
* Rejections hurt, but I have grown to feel numb about them which actually helped a lot. Waiting for that email from a specific company every day might do more harm than good
* My GPA has tanked a bit, but that’s okay
* A leetcode a day keeps the unemployment away
* Leetcode premium is a very good investment if I can afford it
* Leetcode assessments are very good for practicing OA under time pressure
* Having a leetcode study buddy is incredibly helpful to keep myself and my motivation in check
* Getting familiar with the coding environment of the OAs helped a lot with debugging
* For CodeSignal specifically, the first 2 questions are fairly easy, the 3rd question is implementation-heavy (i.e. have to write a lot of code, not necessarily hard), and the 4th question is algorithm-heavy (to avoid TLE). The recommended 1 then 2 then 4 then 3 order of solving helps since I ended up using half of my completion time on question 3.
* I commented my code in my OAs, not sure if anyone took a look but I don't think that would hurt
* Keeping the communication going even when I’m stuck in technical interviews. Some interviewers really appreciated the fact that I conveyed my ideas clearly and continuously, and they were willing to step in if my ideas were not in the right track
* If possible, use the whiteboard feature in Zoom or Coderpad or Hackerrank to explain my ideas to the interviewer. A picture worth a thousand words as they say
* Asking a lot of clarifying questions before diving into the implementation to clear up any miscommunications and/or traps in the question’s wording. It also shows that I am engaged and thought thoroughly about the edge cases, which is always a good thing for being a good engineer
* Weight the upsides and downsides (time complexities, space complexities, etc.) of different implementation approaches before coding
* Take the interviewer’s hints and suggestions constructively, they probably know more than I do
* Try to be personable and come across as a person that the interviewer wants to work with in the future. They might not admit it outright, but subconsciously they might have more inclination to vouch for me favorably
* Ask good questions at the end to demonstrate my interest in the position. I prepared the questions by reading about the company as well as the job description of the role
* I always wear my lucky suit for my interviews, maybe it helped as I felt more confident and calm

**Arista Networks**

* Pay is $43.27/hour with $2,000 relocation
* Location is Santa Clara, CA (HQ)
* All the usual workplace perks like intern events, snacks, gym access, etc
* I enjoyed networks in college and wanted to apply my skills or gain valuable knowledge in industry. Feel like this would give me a broader skillset in Software Engineering (previous internships did full-stack, web development, etc) I also see Arista as a great company that is doing well in their respective markets.

**Intuit**

* Pay is $44/hour with company provided housing
* Location is Mountain View, CA (HQ)
* All the usual workplace perks like intern events, snacks, gym access, etc
* Feel like I would be doing the usual cloud and application development, so not super excited about the work (although this is just speculation). The Intuit name brand is pretty good though so idk about this one.

Essentially I feel like both are great opportunities and not sure what to choose. Since I am looking to work in the Bay Area and hopefully get a return offer, both are great for that as well. Seeking outside opinions.

csMajors,"So im planning on self-studying calc 3. I was wondering if there were any programming exercises / resources that may supplement what I learn as extra practice that makes me see how what I learn relates to programming. I feel as though I'd get a better understanding of topics and would see how it related to CS more if I tried doing something like this. In general, im kind of interested in seeing if this would help me in any sort of maths class in general as someone from a coding background.

For instance, maybe if I learn about derivatives in 3D, I would have problems that involve me needing to calculate derivatives of 3D points in order to solve for sort of coding problem (possibly  algorithmic). Anything resources like this exist (even tangentially)?",Programming exercises that supplement Calc 3?

If all of the unconfirmed benefits are offered, I would definitely choose intuit because I would have slightly more money after tax at the end of the summer and I would be in California.

In this case what should I do? The safe bet would be to sign Capital One because without the intuit benefits I get more money.

My main reasoning was because of the class selection and program orientation. There’s a dedicated school of computing at Gtech, which means the wait for classes will be smaller. I also like the specialization system, and the class selection for what I want to go into (physics engine dev / simulation dev) is much better than Michigans. Gtech is ranked higher too.

My complaints about Michigan stem from just too many people taking EECS, and how classes fill up wayyy too quickly. Also, the classes available are UMich don’t really aid me for the goals that I have. Yeah I can take a course on VSLI design, but it doesn’t help me for physics engines.

csMajors,"Hi, I am transferring to a 4 year university in the Spring after recently completing an associates degree in K-12 Education. This degree covered all my basic college classes and about 4 extra education classes. At the university I will transfer to, I am a history major with secondary teaching licensure. I also am a substitute teacher for our local public school system while I am finishing college. I live off campus with my spouse who is in the military and they plan on staying the service for a long time, which means we may have a duty station overseas in our future. 

With my current college degree plans, that would leave my only career options if we end up overseas being a remote teacher or working at a school on the overseas military base through the Department of Defense. These are solid options, but I believe computer science may be a better one for me. 

The cost per credit hour at the university I will attend is $1,039 (Out of state). So I am looking at a good $30k in debt for a history degree (about 2 more years of school) and teaching license. 

**HOWEVER**

This same university I am attending offers a 100 percent online computer science bachelors degree. **The cost? $407 per credit hour (out of state).** Also, nearly all my credits would transfer into the program and I would only have about 2 years of schooling to be done in this program, like the history one. I've always had a deep passion for computers since I was a kid. I know I am fully capable of the workload and intenseness of the degree, when compared to just a history one. Between the potential remote job opportunities in the future with a CS degree - if we end up overseas and the cost of the degree, it seems like a no brainer to me to switch. The only downside is that I will be unable to do any sort of internship, as I need to stay with my spouse and support our family.

I don't really care too much about the internship pay, I'm more concerned with which company I'll be able to learn more from in terms of technical knowledge and the long term prospects of potentially being a software developer for either company (aka entry level SWE salary).

\-$26/hr, have to find housing and transportation to NH office with 3k stipend, great work life balance, full time pay \~$70-100k entry level??? (on the internet it was highly variable), can choose between 7 tech tracks like backend, full stack, etc.

Vanguard's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$42/hr, housing already provided and near transportation to office, stress-free culture, culture of ""long term stability"", old legacy code, full time pay \~$80k entry level???

First, they sent me a take home assignment, just creating a basic REST API that handles some JSON data. I turned it in, and got my first technical interview. The interviewer found a bug in my code, and thankfully I was able to fix it on the spot. So they told me I'd move on to the final round (onsite) and I was feeling pretty good at that point.

They sent me the itinerary, and I'll be having a DSA, system design, and OOD interview. Each an hour long. My first though was damn, pretty intense for an entry-level role. 

Thankfully, I have to learn OOD for an upcoming final, so I may have a shot there. I don't do LC though. I might could pull off an easier array or string question but anything more advanced than that and I'm fucked. And I do not know a damn thing about system design...

I'm not trying to come off like I'm complaining. I'm grateful for the opportunity, and I've got another offer lined up in case this doesn't work out. But I do feel like the initial take home (which I did well on) was the most like the actual job would be, so it would suck to lose the opportunity because I can't do LC questions. But hopefully, I can show potential in other areas and still impress them enough to get the offer.","Take home, LC, system design, and OOD interview for entry-level..."

csMajors,"So I’m doing a part time internship during the school year atm because I tend to have a lot of free time (spaced out my classes due to having a lot of credits for various reasons, try to spread out difficulty etc as well) and oh my god it’s lovely. It’s at a place I interned previously, and I feel like such a developer! Plus it’s great pay for a part time job (which is, yknow, useful as a broke college student), and I feel like the experience is great. I’m basically just doing dev work as part of one of their teams. Which I know is something you do during a summer internship too, but it’s like- all school year long work experience which I think is super useful and a lot of extra work experience.

And idk it just feels so nice to be doing dev work 🥰. I’m majoring in cs because I love programming so it genuinely is a really enjoyable way to start my day. The work I did over the summer and now is actually used at the company and in production etc and that just feels so great. After my internship over the summer it kinda sucked going back to classes because I really love doing software dev work. I do actually enjoy my classes at university too, but I really like the project work of actual software development/SWE work, and I feel like I learn a lot as an intern as well. So it’s been really nice to start back up doing intern work there (took a while to get through HR so there was a gap at the start of the school year when I wasn’t working). 

Anyway, I know the job market is rough atm (grinding for my summer internship was rough) but there are still places offering part time internships during the school year (this position wasn’t actually posted, my boss just really liked me and wanted me to keep working there, but places do have positions open as well), and it’s definitely something I recommend trying to see if you can continue doing at your summer internship if you live in the area or it was remote. I feel like a lot of people don’t think about it as an option but for me personally it’s been a really great experience!

Also am I the only one who loves feeling so professional and like an actual developer when they work an internship? I’m really looking forward to full time work in the future 

Also as my final side note: this is definitely a reflection of why it’s a good idea to try to do really good work at your internship over the summer (and have good communication and a good relationship with your boss). I highly doubt I would’ve gotten the position if my boss hadn’t really loved my work and advocated for this position to be made for me!",I highly recommend part time internships during the school year

csMajors,"I managed to get 4 final round behavioral interviews (after passing the technical OA/interviews) this cycle with NCAA, Vertex V2X, and 2 small startups, but no offers between them. I took notes during the interview, asked serious questions about the company's management/WLB/general environment, as well as technical questions like the tech stacks they use. I thought most of the conversation flowed naturally, with some pauses in between during each interview.

I think the reason that they did not give me any offers was because I didn't have enough projects to talk about, so I relied quite a bit on asking the interviewers questions. Another reason I think I may have failed is that I didn't have a lot of the skills they wanted, such as SQL or web dev experience (This was through a freshman internship matching program, so my hands were tied with that).

I'm having trouble finding an internship for the upcoming summer, and I want to maximise my chance of getting one, how do I do that? I have school stuff to do too, so I don't have a lot of time and thus I want to spend time doing the thing that gives me maximum return. Possible options:  

\- Just apply to as many places as I can

\- Learn something (elaborated later)

\- Practice a ton of LeetCode stuff

\- Make a project (elaborated later)

\- Languages in order of proficiency: JavaScript, Python, Java, C

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's come back to my questions. I was thinking learning something like React or SQL or something would be helpful since many of the places I've applied to have been like we need someone who knows SQL stuffs and well react or angular or HTML/CSS etc. would be helpful and not super hard since I know JS and wouldn't have to start from the start yk.

Or maybe I should make some project because companies like those a lot.

Or maybe, considering, I'm trying to find an internship this summer and there is not a lot of time left in that, I should just apply to a shit ton of places and play the numbers game.

I am so behind in my intro CS class. I can't focus because I have been dealing with a lot of personal things outside of school. I am trying my best and working hard yet here I am still trying to learn material we already learned in class a long time ago.

It's so intimidating and stressful and daunting seeing so many people in my class who have already been programming for such a long time. There's so many smart and intelligent and successful freshman already.

And everyone is already preparing and thinking about internships. I really want to get a cool internship one day. I really do.

I know that in order to get these cool internships at Google or Meta or Microsoft or Apple, you HAVE to start preparing and applying as soon as possible. But how am I supposed to do that when I can't even keep up with the intro CS class? I know it's stupid for me to be thinking about internships when I don't even understand recursion when I'm supposed to be analyzing algorithms. But I *have* to think about these things as soon as possible right? If I wanna actually do it?

And there's also having to worry about what extracurriculars to do. What do I spend my time on? What projects do I make? What clubs or organizations or programs am I supposed to join? What competitions do I have to win? When do I start LeetCoding? There's so many things to worry about. There's so many CS clubs at my university and I don't know what I have to look at.

csMajors,"Hi guys. So I've been trying to start learning DSA as I have an internship coming up this summer, but I've been really torn between learning Java and Python. Each time I feel like I've settled on one, I keeping telling myself the other might be better. I know there's pros and cons for each, but the main reason I've been thinking about Java is just because there's so many resources. I know there's a really great DSA course that's made by Princeton that is taught in Java, and also Cracking the Coding Interview is also in Java. Obviously Python is also a good choice because the syntax is so simple, but I'm just not sure. The idea of having complete resources for Java is really enticing to me, and I'm not able to find other resource that are as comprehensive for Python. I just wanted to get some input from people who have experience with this kind of thing. Which one do you guys think is better?",Best languages for DSA and interviews?
csMajors,"I completed an interview with a company, financial services company, I attended their summit in August and applied 2 weeks later. I received an OA  3 weeks later and received a super day invitation 7 weeks later. Completed the super day, and I've been waiting and messaged them, and they said they'd have a result by 3 weeks. 

The amount of time this is taking seems a bit suspicious to me, but the super day I had was the best interview experience I had done ever, and had a good impression of the company, out of all my interviews for every year. I feel as if there could be a possibility of rescinding offers even though they're in a stable industry. 

The pay is pretty well 38/hr + $5000 sign-on bonus + 3.3k living bonus. I will have a 1.5 hour each way commuting time. 10-12 weeks Hybrid (1 to 2) days per week. 

I currently have an offer with Fidelity, a company I respect, and has a decent name on this sub as a stepping stone for FAANG. I respect them highly because I applied got a response back after 1 day, and scheduled the next interview for next week. Had the interview the next week, 2 weeks later had the final round, and after the final received an email the day after to schedule a call, and received an offer the day after. I applied to Fidelity in October and they replied so fast so that is extremely respectable. 

The Fidelity offer is not as high, but not that bad either. 37/hr + 3.3 bonus. They are only 1 hour each way. 10 - 12 weeks. Hybrid (3-5days) per 1-2 weeks per month.

Pros

* Easy to get full time return offer
* Apparently amazing intern program, no archaic tech
* Workplace is cool (campus is amazing)
* Full time comp for area's CoL is great
* Apparently can move onto better places soon

Cons

* Winter in Madison is cold as shit
* Legacy tech, complaints about old middle management
* Full time horror stories and burnouts, lots of negative reviews
* Mostly web development, not many transferrable skills

&amp;#x200B;

BNY Mellon - 48.07/hr for 10 weeks, no reloc or housing (its in NY)

Pros

* Easy to get full time return offer (95%)
* Fintech experience and big bank name
* WLB apparently good for fulltime
* Mediocre intern program

Cons

* No housing, NY rent will kill me
* Apparently can't really boost you into fintech
* Possible use of old tech, depends on project
* Full time comp not great (esp in NY)
* Not particularly organized

&amp;#x200B;

Epic would net me 18480 + 1000 - plane tix

BNY would net me 19228 - about 5-6k in rent

BNY would be a lot less money, but in this economy I just want a solid return offer, which both seem to promise. If anyone knows anything about BNY's START program or Epic's internship and anything about their fulltime and which would be better for my career, please let me know.

csMajors,"I am currently taking an SQL class right now. I thought it was going to be a very easy class, but it turns out it is by far my hardest class of the semester. It makes my data structures class seem like a cake walk. That is not to say that I have put more time into my SQL class than my data structures class, but I just hate writing queries.

That is all it has been so far is writing queries. I feel like I am able to decently visualize things such as data structures and algorithms using real programming languages like C++ and assembly, but I just can't visualize what is going on in SQL.

I will try to watch videos on it, and they do very simple queries (so the videos are useless), while in my class the queries are insane. Every lesson builds on the last, so I am starting to get behind. I somehow got a 100 on the second midterm which is keeping me afloat, and I am sitting at like an 88 right now, but it will surely drop and I am used to getting all A's.

I hate this class so much. Nothing frustrates me as much as SQL. It feels like the language keeps you from doing things that should work. I just want to put my fist through a wall over and over again while doing my assignments. Every question is combinations of  different types of joins, subqueries, window functions, etc, etc... 

I have heard that many jobs will ask complex interview question on SQL. I did some SQL during my internship, but it was mostly just adding or removing stuff to/from tables. Once this course is over I really don't want to even have to consider writing a query again, but it seems that it is a necessary skill. At this point I have practically given up and think I am just going to take the L on my grade. Fuck SQL to hell.

I recently participated in a CS conference and after a month or so I got an email from a Woven Planet recruiter that my concentration and prev internship/work experience matches what they're looking for.

csMajors,"Hello! So i just today received an internship related to computer science (yay!) but I am now wondering if I should accept it or possibly transfer early.
 So a little backstory. I was originally going to transfer in spring 2024 to a CSU (i go to a community college). Well I found out recently that more classes are required to transfer with an ADT which would increase my time here at community college by a whole year (i have been here for 3 years already and am dying to transfer). I could transfer into fall 2023 potentially to a CSU but that means I wouldn't be able to take the internship. This decision to transfer was made after I applied as I was not aware before. I am not sure if I would get in but I'm hoping I will? I am a local student to both CSUs I applied to and have a 3.9 GPA. 
Should I take an extra semester in community college for the internship? Or just transfer asap. If I choose to transfer I can also get a head start and take some summer classes as well which I like. Thank you for any advice :)",Internship or transfer early? Need advice please

However, my goal is to move to the US asap.

As a new grad, I'll be graduating with 7 internships. RBC Amplify (Summer 2023), RBC Capital Markets (Winter 2023), IBM (Summer 2022), BlackBerry (Winter 2022), OpenText (Fall 2021), and 2 startups (Summer 2021, Winter 2021).

I was able to pull this off because school was online during covid, and I attend a shit-tier university in Ontario.


Having said that, how realistic would it be for me to land a role in the US as a new grad, or maybe 2 years out?

I'm leetcoding like crazy rn, so that when new grad apps role out in around 8 months, I'll be very well prepared. On top of that, I'm studying systems design.

Now, I have the database, table, and migration scripts set up for my project, and I hope to at least get the backend working with the API and DAO layer by the end of the internship, and I don't think I have time to build out the front end to actually display the data I am storing and retrieving for my project.

I got my first bachelor’s degree in psychology (overall university ranked at \~20 and psychology program ranked at \~10 by US News and World Report). During my psychology degree, I was a research assistant for multiple years, secured research grants, and coauthored some psych journal articles.

After graduating with my first degree, I immediately began and finished a second bachelor’s degree in computer science at a mid-tier university (overall university ranked at \~50 and CS program ranked at \~50 by US News and World Report).

After finishing the second degree, I’ve been working as a software engineer at a small tech company for about a year (recruiters would not consider this company as prestigious and most have probably never heard of the company).

So the question kinda covers it I guess. I have applied to close to 100 remote internships, and have even heard back from a few induvial.

csMajors,I'm in second year learning C and Java currently. Last year I learned Python. Last year for the OOP assignments I had a very difficult time with them. I understood the concept of OOP fine. But I had a very hard time actually implementing it. Compared to this year where the assignments are way more complicated and I'm still having a way easier time with them.

csMajors,"I’m not even trolling, this is actually my situation. 

Quick background / how I “studied”


I started studying February 19th. I started off paying for leetcode premium and trying to learn the basics off of there. I remember making handwritten notes of these basics but I cannot find them. I learned hash tables, stacks, queues, linkedlist, and binary search trees. 

Then, May 14th, I watched one youtube video from a guy with pretty poor beginner advice (ex. Don’t code until you know how to solve the problem, as if you can do an entire technical interview in your head), and structured my studying for the next couple months around his questions.I attempted a leetcode hard the very next day (word search II) and just copied the code once from some youtube video and left the problem. I even left a note saying “I don’t understand”. 

Then, i transitioned into   https://neetcode.io/practice , and attempted problems while using neetcodes youtube videos. I copied code and every time I  copied, i followed these rules:
Rule 1. Don’t write any code until you know how to solve the problem
Draw it out while talking through it in english
Psuedocode
Then code

What ended up happening, on every single coding question, was that i always skipped A and B because you didn’t know how to talk through or psuedocode the problem, and went straight to C, copying down code. 

My comments consist of text straight from the video, but i never really had deep understanding of how to solve the problem, and I didn’t try to solve the problem on my own with no help after i seen the solution. I drew out code on white boards and took pictures of it, put all my code in intellij, but I still never really attempted problems yourself with no help because i never knew how. 

I upgraded the way I approached problems and did it systematically, and this was the system i developed: 

Rule 1. Write down the name of the problem and what the problem is asking for

Rule 2. Draw it out while talking it through in english(use previously written documents steps 2-4)

Rule 3. Pseudocode 

Rule 4. Code. 

Rule 5. View solution and run it in intellij to see if it works. Watch it once and pretend you’re the guy in the video, mock what he’s saying. Then watch it again while coding and making comments. 

Rule 6. Whiteboard

Rule 7.  Answer the final question, “What is one thing I could have known or done that would have made everything else easier?”

Rule 8. Write working code in notebook

Notice how i never attempted the problem myself wit no help. I ran it in intellij to make sure it worked, wrote it on the whiteboard, and then moved on. I never really learned how to solve the problem, i only learned how to copy the answer.


WHAT I THINK I’M DOING WRONG

First things first, my studying is disorganized. I’m pulling from different sources, not writing things down, not writing clear notes, etc. 

I also notice a lack of consistency. I started learning the basics on leetcode, and then never finished any category above 55%(arrays, graphs, hash tables, BST’s). I don’t even know where my handwritten notes are. 

Then, from February 19th, there is a large gap of time where I can’t find evidence that i even attempted to do anything, and then, may 14th, almost three months later, I watch one youtube video from some guy with pretty poor beginner advice, and then attempted a leetcode hard the next day.

Then I spent the next couple months copying problem solutions I didn’t understand in my notebook. 

tl;dr - used YouTube videos I didn’t understand to “study”, and by study, I mean copy solutions without understanding them. I still don’t know how to do a leetcode easy 9 months later. What can I change, what resources can I use, how can I do better?",Can’t even do a leetcode easy after 9 months of studying. Please criticize my study habits?

#### I do NOT refer to snippety one-line answers at the back of a textbook, student solution manuals that solve merely some or half of the exercises, or solution manuals  restricted to instructors. 

 1. Robert  Ash (1935-2015), [Preface](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~r-ash/RV/RVPreface.pdf) to [*Real Variables with Basic Metric Space Topology*](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~r-ash/RV.html).

 &gt;I rely especially on one of the most useful of all learning devices: the inclusion of detailed solutions to exercises. Solutions to problems are commonplace in elementary texts but quite rare (although equally valuable) at the upper division undergraduate and graduate level. This feature makes the 
book suitable for independent study, and further widens the audience. 

 2. David Patrick, *Introduction to Counting and Probability* (2005), page v. 

&gt;However, 
if you are using this book on your own to learn independently, then you probably have a copy of the 
solution book, in which case there are some very important things to keep in mind: 
&gt;
&gt;1. Make sure that you make a serious attempt at the problem before looking at the solution. Don't 
use the solution book as a crutch to avoid really thinking about a problem first. You should think 
*hard* about a problem before deciding to give up and look at the solution. 
&gt;
&gt;2. **After you solve a problem, it's usually a good idea to read the solution, even if you think you know 
how to solve the problem. The solution that's in the solution book might show you a quicker or 
more concise way to solve the problem, or it might have a completely different solution method 
that you might not have thought of. [emboldening mine]** 
&gt;
&gt;3. If you have to look at the solution in order to solve a problem, make sure that you make a note of 
that problem. Come back to it in a week or two to make sure that you are able to solve it on your 
own, without resorting to the solution.","What computer scientists have advocated for freely publicizing detailed solutions, to every exercise?"

I'm currently a Canadian graduating senior in a non-CS major (bio), and for the past 3 years I've been deciding between medical school and software engineering. 2 summers ago I did Microsoft Explore, but reneged on my SWE return offer (yes I know, an absolute MORON move) for this summer as I got a research internship that I thought would help for medical school. Fast forward to this summer and I realized I HATE the idea of the grind associated with medicine, but now I'm fucked because I literally threw away the perfect opportunity to get into big tech.

So, now I'm trying to pivot back into tech and apply for SWE internships for winter 2023 or summer 2023 (which will delay my graduation but probably put me on track for a return NG), or SWE FT (suboptimal as I really wanted an in-person internship), but sadly both of these are pretty difficult. I thought I would have more luck with getting interviews with the Microsoft name on my resume, but I guess given my relative lack of experience and the current economy AND the fact I need sponsorship, it's no surprise I haven't gotten anything.

so we just started learning about amortized analysis (the accounting method and the potenial method) and Im having hard time with this.

1. in effort to try and see more exampples (right now in class we saw only 2 examples for amortized analysis) I found this lect notes:  
 [lect0922.pdf (cmu.edu)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect0922.pdf)   
Im having a bit of problem with 7.6 (example 3-page 4) "" . Now, in a sequence of n increments, a single increment could cost as much as n (actually 2n − 1) ""  
why its actually 2n-1 ? I feel like Im missing ""basic"" stuff here  
if we look at 000  
to flip A\[2\] (the leftmost digit)  
001  
010  
011  
100  
and it took us 4 times  
is it because in the accounting method we consider each inceremnt as cost of 2?  

2. in general the potenial method is a bit ""heavy"" for my understanding, Im having trouble understanding how to know what potenial function to give, I find it a bit hard to find examples online (mostly find the same 3/4 examples in every place)  
if someone has reccomendation where to read/see examples would love to hear(trying to read through clrs, but I feel like I need to see more examples of how to come up with potenial function, especially with O(log n) and O(n\^2)

I've been actively in the job hunt for about a year and a half and even though I got a gig at my university but I'm still looking for a real internship at a company.

I think that the constant cycle of being close to getting a role and passing technicals and OAs to rejections made me develop anxiety issues that I've been noticing recently. It's probably a result of constantly going down rabitholes of thoughts on how the decisions were made about me.

I keep having paranoid thoughts about people hating me and I just freaked out at my friend because I thought he suddenly started hating me for some reason and it's all over a late reply to a text.

Submitted app early September, offer mid November

Notes:

OA: For the 90 minute OA, focus on code reusability. The questions build upon each other and you should be copying your methods from one problem to another. Not really leetcode-esque. Keep some sort of note about your OA code either afterward in a doc or just simply recreate it in another editor for reference for the technical interview. I got 34/35 cases

Phone Screen: The phone screen is a broad 30 minute culture fit to see where you fall. Asked about my gaming history and prior work experience. They were  transparent in telling me what teams my skills aligned with. This decision sets up who you’ll be interviewing with for the next rounds. Otherwise they might place you with whoever they think you fit with. 

Technical Round: I think I got lucky for the technical screen. This 60 minute interview goes over your OA answer and asks some basic DSA questions about it. I got sent my OA results from my recruiter which gave me a lot of time to revise my solution, find optimizations, and just understand my own sloppy code to explain to the interviewer. Without this, I don’t think I would have passed this round. This interviewer was a nice Engineering Manager and stayed 20 minutes over to talk about Riot.

Behavioral Round: The first 60 minute values behavioral interview without an engineer was extremely chill. Not the most conversational interview but I only received generic behavioral questions which were easy. Always frame answers in the S.A.O format and try to exemplify Riot’s values when you can. My interviewer really appreciated this. In terms of preparation, I won’t lie I may have gone overkill. I made a doc answering potentially every question I could get asked, why I wanted to intern at riot, etc. It was nice when I could quickly spin up an example that I prepared after being asked a question. Helped me get through a lot of questions.

Hiring manager round: Scheduled for 60 ended in 30. Was critical about my responses which made me fumble my words sometimes. A big focus on Value Alignment. The questions may seem random but they care more about the way you frame your answer than the actual response imo. For example “tell me about a goal of yours”, they care about how you define goals and execute them rather than the actual goal. It’s all about how you think and if that mindset aligns with the team/company. I ran out of questions to ask so instead of fabricating my interest I just thanked them for their time.

Closing thoughts: This whole process is half soft skills and half luck imo. I suck at leetcode and I don't have the strongest technical background. I just did my research on the company, spent time to be able to explain my past experiences, and had some interviewers I clicked with.",Riot Games Interview Process

Hi,
I'm an international prospective student thinking of applying for a Masters in CS in the US &amp; Canada. Looking at the macro economic conditions like Tech layoffs, likely _mild_ recession, the Ukraine conflict, I'm confused as to whether to apply or not.

I'm done with all my exams (GRE/IELTS), documents and everything. I just have to submit my applications and I think I'm getting cold feet.

So, my questions are:

1. What are the intern opportunities in Summer of 24 and beyond? 

2. What would be the state of hiring by 2024-25?

3. Is it worth it to let go of my current SWE job in my home country for pursuing this?

The other option I have is to wait an year out and apply for Fall 2024.

My ultimate goal would be to do as many internships as possible (helping me to understand various fields within tech itself) during my masters and land a good role for FTE.","Fall 2023, is it worth?"

csMajors," Currently in third year studying Computer Engineering hoping to peruse a career in SWE. With all the talks about the recession, culture resets, and yes state of Twitter I am getting pretty worried. Seems like saturation is at its highest levels I think for SWE. Is this the start where tech/swe starts to dwindle? Does anyone have any tips on how to focus on a niche or choosing one perhaps to help with the odds and maybe stand out? I am starting to even consider a post-secondary program because of this, but I am unsure how worth that is. I am currently in a co-op program where I have to do 6 terms=2 years of internship experience to graduate, which can help but the jobs I have only gotten so far were pretty general full-stack ones, nothing that can help me stand out super out of the crowd.

I am pretty passionate about SWE, and yes of course money is also an incentive. I am mainly interested in distributed systems and would love to pursue that. The whole web3 blockchain space interests me as well, specifically in the distributed systems aspect. But of course I cannot tell if this is just a fad and will last.

coding stats: 

1. codesignal 841 (just got this 2 days ago, failed databricks, roblox, zoom, and instabase with 780, so it's too late anyways)
2. solved 89 LC questions w/ distribution 26 easy/57 med/6 hards (finished all non-LC-premium problems on blind 75 except 3 hards) 

i started applying september 29th, and now i have applied to 208 places, received 33 OAs, 12 of which I got a perfect score on. Of which, i only received 3 interviews, and i've failed 1 and only have 2 left. this is my first mistake - applying late september, when the gold was during late july + early august.

i am writing this after failing doordash interview: i know my mistake, and it's just a skill issue - at this point, i am more angry than anything else. i spend many hours thinking over LC questions and talking to people at my school, but i'm not improving at all. i know i'm not improving simply because of my performance - everyone else knows how to solve these simple ass questions, but in that doordash interview, i had 1 question which i understood but could not implement, and i'm kicking myself everyday for it. my classes/sleep are suffering so much. 

tbh, i could care less about what jobs my friends had (so many classmates are going to insane firms), that's not causing me my negative emotions - i'm so angry and disappointed because i am not getting better. i am always missing a little bit, and despite what i do - day by day i'm at the same skill level. i try to put my anger into my studies, and there are days where i sit in the library for 17 hours drinking soylent as my meals trying to grind harder and harder. i don't think i will burn out because im so desparate for improvement - i just keep imagining what it feels like to have a future and that is the biggest motivator of them all, but it is not enough

csMajors,"I can't count how many applications I made... Here's the journey.

Non-CS Eng bachelor (outside of US) =&gt; took CS undergrad fundamentals (non-degree) =&gt; CS MS from 2020.

No internship till May 2022. (I didn't think it seriously because I didn't have experience getting a job in the US and how much it is important to have internship experience for getting a job)

I was supposed to graduate in May 2022. But I failed to get any offer. Summary is

* Application total: 600 (backend, data science, machine learning...new grad that doesn't provide any specific area)
* Internship: Nothing
* Project: one class project
* LC: 250 (easy: 150, medium: 100, hard: 0)
* Codesignal: 842 (I was lucky...)
* Major results: eBay final, Bloomberg final, Adobe final, Lucid (chart) final. MAANG: resume screened. 20\~30 automating OA companies.

Since I didn't have any offers, it was very risky to graduate without any offers. So I deferred my graduation to this Dec 22.

I tried to equip myself with a few things.

* internship: got a start-up internship this summer, and found another internship this fall.
* ground LC: so far 1200 (easy 300, medium: 700, hard: 200)
* learned frontend part (javascript, typescript, swift) and DB (SQL) - did toy projects
* prepared individual projects at least one for the area I apply (frontend, backend, iOS, general NG SWE)
* prepared different versions of my resume: for general, frontend, data science, ML, data engineer

However, the situation dramatically changed... economic recession and I felt it was harsher for international students who required sponsorship (at least, a person who should answer 'yes' to the question 'do you need a sponsorship now or in the future?' although they didn't stick to sponsorship concerning this economic situation). As a result...

* Application total: 1,000 (a little bit more than that... from the time over 400, I didn't count it but set doing it as one of the everyday morning routines. visit LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, Angel.co, RippleMatch, and two or three more)
   * general SWE including backend specific, frontend specific: approx 700
   * data science: 100
   * ML: 100
   * data engineer: 100
   * iOS: 20
* Target position:
   * new grad: 600
   * early career or job description says like this: 400
* Codesignal: 840\~849
* Triplebyte: excellent (DS, Algo, python, javascript), great (react, swift)
* Hackerrank: solved everything with efficient time/space complexity
* Summary:
   * MAANG: ghosted (Microsoft explicitly rejected me)
      * AWS: did phone interview and invited to virtual on-site but pending (unlimited...)
   * Companies I was in the final round in the previous: resume screened (interesting...)
   * Unicorn (or famous tech companies): resume screened
   * As a result, among 1,000 applications =&gt; 10 OAs =&gt; 3 phones =&gt; 2 on-sites =&gt; 1 offer

I guess there are many folks who are actively looking for an offer. Especially for those who inevitably should graduate in Dec with F1 status, I would say  I know how stressful it is...

csMajors,"I want to prioritize career growth, return offer rate, and work-life balance. Internship pay is not a huge factor. Capital One would be in McLean, VA and Robinhood would either be in NYC, Seattle, or Menlo Park.

Reasons to choose C1: high return offer rate (important to me given the economic uncertainty in the next year), bigger intern cohort / well-run internship program, good work-life balance, intern housing included. I'm also a bit concerned about Robinhood's recent layoffs and general instability over the past year.

Reasons to choose Robinhood: higher new-grad compensation ($200k vs $120k), might stand out more on resume, interesting projects, flexibility to be remote most days of the week

I have been coding mostly in JAVA and my plan is to intern in the Summer of 2024 as a backend software engineer on the CPT status, graduate in Spring 2025, and be employed on an OPT status.

I am really focused on getting into the industry right after graduation without considering doing Masters in CS. Thus, I am personally preferring SJSU at the moment for its location and tuition, but I am also open to other thoughts and opinions that could change my mind.

Will I really be more exposed to career opportunities at SJSU despite the prestige title of graduating from VT?

csMajors,"Currently have offers for both companies as a junior in college. Having such a hard time deciding because of remote vs. in-person and company work.

**Appian**

Right off the bat, Appian culture seems impressive. They are an old public company. They flew me out for an explore HQ day, and I felt the company valued developing young talent so they could be prepared in the workplace. The campus is also great, and many employees work at the office daily.

My concerns are the hourly rate, and they seem to be using outdated tech stacks that might limit relevant learning. Furthermore, McLean is not the best location, and the new-grad return salary is lower than industry standards.

**Tanium**

Tanium is an old Unicorn. The company also seems to have great talent and a similarly decent product. It is also private with a distant IPO opportunity, but I am unsure whether it will become public anytime soon.

For Tanium, I am concerned about working remotely as I have worked remotely before, and it was such a bad experience in terms of mentorship and growth. They said I could move near their Emeryville Office, but most of their employees are remote.

My goal for the summer is to grow professionally as much as possible. I have no idea which route I should take. Does anyone have any advice for me? I appreciate you all so much. Comments would be SOOO appreciated.

I am currently doing a CS major with an econ minor, and I can relate to my econ minor by reading the news. Is there any way I can read about applications of what I am learning in my CS major, whether it be algorithms and data structures and how they're applied to real life software, or how software design is used in real software? 

Whenever I am studying through my lecture notes or watching a YouTube video explaining a concept, there is always a hypothetical example being given. I get why this is, as most software is confidential and so it would be tough to see how algorithms and everything else is used in them. But there surely has to be a way for there to be more concrete examples of what I am learning. I know the best way to learn is to apply the concepts, which I am trying to do, but I feel like it would severely help my abilities and interests in what I'm doing if I could HOW these concepts are used in things I actually use in real life, akin to how a materials science major would be able to understand the aluminum alloys that build airplanes.

csMajors,"I have received an offer from a DoD company for the summer (sounds like I'll be using C/C++) for $23 an hour. But I originally planned on doing leetcode and summer classes during this period. 

To try to give as much background as possible:

-I am a sophomore CS student at a Top 30 State University

-I have previous experience in IT Support intern (last summer + this fall), and 1 semester of being a Math TA

-This spring I will be doing a Co-op position as a Data Engineer at a mid sized healthcare+technology company for $24 an hour, (seems to be only using Microsoft Azure, Power BI, and SQL Servers) and not sure if I will be able to use any programming languages. Also will be a grader for a python data structures class this spring

-I was originally ahead with classes, but if I do both the Co-op and internship I might be a little behind

Currently, I have no internships under my belt and have been trying pretty hard these past few months to get one with no luck. 120+ applications with a poor GPA and OA fails with good companies but it is what it is, wish i started my preparation earlier. Anyways, I had originally thought i was graduating in Spring 2024 which made me really push for an internship this summer, however my advisor is advising that I should take summer courses this Summer 2023 and go for an internship next Summer 2024. The main reason why she thinks I should do my summer courses now is due to the fact that certain classes aren't offered every summer, and it is best I take them while I can before I get to Summer 2024 and my required courses aren't being offered at that time. Going through with this, I believe I would have a greater chance at receiving an internship for next summer as I'd have more preparation time and a better GPA to help my apps.  I could really just use some opinions on this, considering the current job market, hiring freezes and whatnot, along with me not trusting my school the most when it comes to this kind of stuff.",Do I keep trying for an internship or try next summer?

csMajors,"I am currently attending Holberton School Tulsa, a tech vocational school, that offers several tracks.  The most interesting to me are Machine Learning, Full-Stack Web Development, and AR/VR Development.

I am leaning most towards FS, however, I'm definitely struggling, so here are the arguments for and against each one:

- Full Stack Web Development:
    - Jobs everywhere
    - Remote positions common
    - Skills are ""a mile wide and an inch deep"" (I will be learning Front-end, Back-end, and Middle-ware, which means I will likely not know any of them *well*)
    - Flooded marked - too many web developers (?)
    - Moderately interested (especially for the prospect of remote work)

- Machine Learning
    - Not as many jobs (?)
    - Very abstract
    - Higher earning potential in the long run (?)
    - Less interested
    - Only use Python (pro or con?)

- AR/VR Development
    - Most interested
    - Least prospect of getting a job?
    - Only use C#/Unity

My overall goals:
- I would love to work remotely, at least later in my career.
- I would love to be an entrepreneur eventually.

csMajors,"Hi! Hopefully this is allowed. I always found it super helpful to read other people's experiences, so I wanted to share mine :)  !

So I did the New Tech program last summer (if you're a freshman or sophomore I HIGHLY recommend it) and as such, moved directly to final round interviews for MSFT. I finished the program back in early August, and just now interviewed. With hiring freezes and all this tech stuff the folks in the program were really fighting for us, and I'm crazy thankful that they were able to advance all the New Techs to the final round— they really do watch out for the people who do it. But I had my interview yesterday, which went something like this:

11:20: Did a ""sign in"" call, where we went over the logistics of the interview. It was an interview ""day"" so a ton of people went. Seventy plus I think.

1:00: I had my interview! It went great. I spent the majority of it talking about my resume, which my interviewer asked me a ton of questions about. He asked me a lot about my projects and whether I preferred Backend or Frontend work, and I was very honest about preferring backend. We got to the last ten minutes of the interview and I figured that I probably wouldn't get a coding question— but I did! He asked me about semaphores, and I was like ""what are those?"", so he suggested I read about them while he set up the coding question environment. I did and pretty quickly identified that it was a type of multi-threading programming, which I told him. He seemed happy with this answer and asked me to implement a few functions of a semaphore class, which I was able to do pretty quick, and was able to use a few functions present in thread classes, which I knew from a few projects I'd done. He asked me a few more questions and then off I went to my second interview.

2:00: My second interview also went super well. My interviewer and I chatted for a bit and hit it off, then we went into a programming question, where I essentially implemented a Hashmap with an array list. There was some context surrounding it, but that was the main thing. It took me a second to think of a solution, but he seemed pleased with what I did come up with. I asked him a ton of questions about his work, then ended the interview.

I agonized about it all day and got an offer about an hour ago! Hopefully this helps some people out :D",MSFT Interview Experience (Offer received)
csMajors,"I'm going to preface this by saying I'm **very** grateful for my position.

**PREFACE:**

I'm a senior in college and have a very safe offer from an automotive company for a LCOL/MCOL living area with \~105k TC.

I've been interview prepping seriously for about half a year, have made tremendous progress, and can do most LC mediums, (excluding unique topics). Though I am getting rusty because I haven't touched LC in a few weeks.

A lot of my applications were simply too late in regard to when I applied. The positions I wanted most which I thought I applied early for ended up getting frozen or are being processed tremendously slowly and look bleak in likely outcome.

The current offer I have is the only offer on my table and I intend to accept it. I was relatively confident in obtaining a higher salary and working for a more modern tech-based company but things just didn't work out that way this year for me it seems, and I'm ok with that knowing I have much time ahead of me.

**QUESTION:**

My question is, where do I go from here? My start date is June and I'll be moving there entirely alone. **My goal is to basically learn as much as I can at this job and double+ my TC very quickly out of the desire to give my family a better lifestyle and retire my folks.**

Do you guys think I should just do a certain amount of leetcode a week/topic review per week to stay comfortable and slowly get better at LC? Do I just apply to new companies for new grad/SDE 1 positions the moment they may possibly reopen next year (FAANG+)? Is there any unique or general advice you feel I would find helpful?

Is there any precedent to an underclassman offer being converted to a full SWE offer?

I thought I would be at an advantage because my resume has a lot of content, but after 400+ applications, 3 rejections (after 2 rounds of interview) and no offers, I'm really worried.

I'm supposed to find a co-op (basically a 6-month internship) for Spring (Jan to June), but I still haven't found one. I've applied to pretty much all the software/data jobs on my university portal, and a ton of jobs with the simplify extension, and so far, I've only been getting rejections.

My three interviews all went very well (I thought), and for two of them, the interviewer even told me that this went well, but I still got rejected. 

I do think that the biggest mistake I made was not applying earlier. I only started applying around September because our career counselors required us to get clearance and have our resumes checked before we could start applying. I didn't know how early the cycle started, so I thought I was on time in applying.

I just interviewed for a company that spent two hours having their engineers flex their company's software, and the technical question was so easy it seemed like more of a subjective personality test than anything else.

I also hate how they have this pompous attitude about how a technical question will be ""casual"" and ""collaborative"" only to be as vague as possible whenever I ask clarifying questions, acting like robots. Despite all of this, even when I find the most optimal solution while talking to a brick wall of an interviewer, and they tell me I did a great job explaining my thought process, I get rejected anyways.

Hi guys,

I am starting my degree in software engineering in 2023 (a 3-year program), and I have become increasingly interested in the role of a quantitative developer. As such, I have a few questions for current developers about their day-to-day job, as well as questions in relation to the preparation they did to land the role they are in now. Questions are listed below are divided according to these two categories:



Day-to-day

\- Difference being a developer at a prop trading firm vs HFT vs Hedge fund vs Investment bank

\- How varied is your day-to-day challenges? 

\- How much autonomy do you have as a junior?






Preparation 

\- For someone starting a software engineering degree, what would be the best areas to focus on (from reading online it seems like ML is a big emphasis)? I am trying to make a decision as to what I should major in within software engineering 

\- What language would be the best to learn? I have read that C++ is the gold standard in the financial world. 

\- How did you prepare from a finance perspective?

\- Recommendations for resources (courses, books, youtubers). 

\- Recommendations for good projects to do that would sharpen the skillsets you require the most as a quantitative developer

\- How did you divide your time between leetcode problems, projects, courses like algo expert, interview questions, and finance concepts?

I know this is quite a loaded question but it would be great to get an inside perspective!

Many people (especially in this sub) say things along the lines of

&gt;Grind for 4 years and then be rich for the rest of your life

I have two problems with this.

Firstly, this is a very selective field. No two ways around it, even in periods of rampant hiring, it's very difficult to land one of these dream FAANG/Fintech jobs which pay a lot and have amazing benefits. There are about 2 million people in the US with a Computer Science degree currently in the workforce. The reality is probably about 1% of those people will ever work for one of these dream companies. Getting to that level takes a certain amount of natural ability and lots of hard work. If you genuinely hate CS, you probably don't have that much natural ability (we generally enjoy the things we are good at). So, to make up that difference you have to work even harder than someone who starts out stronger than you. If you hate CS, you are going to be absolutely miserable trying to do this and more than likely you will fail for this reason. Now, on the other hand if you have a passion for CS don't be discouraged... one of my favorite quotes is, ""the man who loves to walk will walk farther than the man who loves the destination"".

Second, let's suppose you overcome your hate for CS enough to land one of these dream jobs. Dope. You have a good salary. Now you have to work the next 40+ years of your life, working 40 hours a week every week doing something that makes you miserable.

csMajors,"Coming from someone who has indeed grinded leetcode, I will say that if you don't manage to get interviews from high tier companies (FAANG+, HFTs, etc.) grinding LC is just a way to feel good about wasting your time. 

And even if you do get these interviews, half the time the difficult part of the interview isn't even LC related, it might be system design, it might be OOP, it might even be something irrelevant to computer science.

Mid/Lower tier companies (anything below FAANG) ask fairly straightforward programming questions. It's almost never harder than the questions on blind 75.

That's not to say that LC isn't useful, I just think it's much smarter to heavily weight your time and effort towards doing interesting projects that help your resume rather than studying LC. Because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much LC you do if you can't even get interviews that require them in the first place.",Unpopular Opinion - Grinding LC is highly overrated.

csMajors,"So I've seen a lot of posts recently asking how to get good at leetcode. I see countless posts from beginners who don't know how to start and panic at not being able to solve easies despite taking a ds&amp;a course. I see posts from those who have done 200+ questions but still can't reliably solve mediums on their own. As someone who recently went through the journey of going from zero DS&amp;A knowledge to interview-ready in 4 months. I figured I'd write a step-by-step guide of what I did to help everyone out. This post is not intended to be a philosophical discussion on whether leetcode is appropriate for interviews, this will be an actionable guide with concrete steps that you can follow.

**Who am I and why you should listen to me:**

I have to preface this guide with my background so you can trust that I know what I'm talking about. I'm a recent mechanical engineering graduate from a Canadian university who self-studied computer science and web development and landed a software engineer role. Part of this self-study process involved learning DS&amp;A and leetcode which took 4 months by studying 3-4 hours a day, 6 days a week. At the start of my journey, I couldn't even solve easies. After these 4 months, I'm now able to consistently (90% of problems) solve mediums in ~20 minutes and hards in ~35 minutes on my own. I also usually solve OAs (tiktok, SIG, IMC, blackrock, pure storage, c3 ai, cisco, tower research) with 100% test cases, and scored 822 on my one codesignal gca attempt (not the best, ran out of time debugging q3 lol). I've done 6 leetcode questions during onsite interviews and have optimally solved all of them. I'm not trying to flex, just trying to show that what I'm saying is credible.

**My overall strategy:**

As a preface, the goal of this guide is to deeply understand the techniques needed to solve LC problems at an abstract level and implement your abstract solution quickly. My approach is based off how technical material is taught in university courses. What they do is teach a strategy/technique at an abstract level, walk through solving guided example problems using that strategy, have students practice through assignments and practice finals, then apply what you've learned on the actual exams. My overall approach to learning is breadth -&gt; depth -&gt; breadth. First learning what you’ll be learning (breadth), learning those specific topics with a full and deep understanding (depth), then tying the specific topics back into the big picture and how they relate to each other (breadth). I also write summary notes after I read through a topic, I find this lets me take all the information and form a generalized abstraction of the topic along with critical specifics, and if I’m able to write a page of well-structured notes using my own understanding of what I just learned then that means I understand the topic deeply. I also re-read these notes at the end of each of the 4 steps for spaced-repetition effects or when I need to jog my memory since re-reading my own written notes takes me back to the mental state I was in when I first wrote them.

**Step 1: Learn Python (or Java or C++):**

The first step is to get familiar with your programming language of choice. I chose Python and recommend you do the same if you have time, but if you’re in a rush then just use whatever you’re familiar with as long as it’s acceptable in coding interviews (Python, Java, C++). Python is the least verbose language and most similar to plain pseudo code, and in a timed test every minute counts. It lets you spend less time on implementation and more time on figuring out the abstract algorithm which is where the bottleneck is for coding interviews. You need to be familiar with a language before you can learn DS&amp;A so you can concurrently learn the language implementations of data structures and algorithms. To learn Python I just went through the W3 Schools’ guide on syntax and overall language specs (dynamic typing, garbage collection, etc.). The official docs are good as well but they have a lot of stuff that you don’t need for coding interviews. I also took notes on the syntax (6 pages). This step took me 10 hours split across 3 days.

**Step 2: Learn DS&amp;A:**

With DS&amp;A you need to learn how each data structure and algorithm works deeply at an abstract level. For me this meant visualizing a gif of the algorithm in my head, learning the time space complexities of operations the DS/A supports and why they are what they are, learning how the DS/A handles edge cases, and writing an implementation in Python. The resource I used was the interactive ebook PythonDS3 by Runestone Academy. It’s full of word explanations, diagrams, and live code in an editor that you can play around with. It first explains each DS/A at an abstract level, then shows you the Python implementation. I would go through a page/sub-section, think about the concepts deeply and piece everything together in my head, then write a page of notes on that topic. As a preface, I used Tech Interview Handbook’s study plan to figure out which topics are important and I need to take notes on, and which are not which I would only read. I also used Tech Interview Handbook’s topic-by-topic cheatsheet to confirm time and space complexities and how the DS/A is used in problems. This step took me 6 weeks, and I tried to finish 1 subsection per day. Each subsection only takes 30 minutes to read, but I would reread, think deeply about what I read, google stuff I didn’t understand, sometimes watch a youtube video if I still didn’t understand it fully, and write my summary notes which all took about 3 hours per subsection.

**Step 3: Learn Leetcode techniques/strategies (patterns):**

So here is the most important step that I see a lot of people get wrong. People tend to jump straight into practicing leetcode problems and end up having to do 300+ problems to get interview-ready. The issue with this is that LC problems are designed with particular established strategy in mind, and if you’re trying to learn the strategy from particular problems then that’s very inefficient. This would be like in calculus, trying to learn the chain rule, fundamental theorem, monotonic convergence by jumping into doing calculus practice finals, or in linear algebra, trying to learn matrix operations, finding eigenvalues, or SVD decomposition by jumping into doing linear algebra finals. You can clearly see how inefficient this approach is. Furthermore, many of these strategies came from breakthrough papers in computer science that took PhDs to come up with and have many pages of rigorous proof. Trying to come up with these strategies from scratch or induction from LC problems would require you to be a genius. Now you see why so many people get stuck at this step, they’re doing it completely wrong. The resource I used for this is Grokking the Coding Interview and Grokking Dynamic Programming by Design Gurus and Educative.io (no affiliations). These courses are paid but the information is truly worth the money, as it’s by far the best resource I’ve found for this step and the time and energy you’ll save compared to using other resources is well-worth it. If you really can’t afford it then I’ve heard good things about Leetcode Explore cards. There’s also a Hackernoon article on coding interview patterns that summarizes the patterns taught in Grokking, but they’re pretty succinct and don’t offer the depth of information that I think you need. You could pair that with the CSES Competitive Programmer's Handbook to pick out and learn the specific strategies covered by Grokking. I basically used this the same way as with DS&amp;A. For each pattern, I read the primer, read the solutions to the first few problems, tried to solve a few of the later problems in my head abstractly (5-10 minutes of thinking) using the strategy taught in the first few problems, then read the remaining problems (each pattern has 5-14 example problems). Once I finished a pattern, I would piece together the information into an abstract strategy, the situations in which that strategy can be used, what makes the strategy more/less efficient compared to other options, common characteristics in problems where I should consider this strategy, along with its edge cases and time/space complexity, and write down my page of notes. This is probably the most difficult step of the whole plan as you’ll be flexing your brain for abstract thinking and logical reasoning. It'll likely be very difficult to think that hard but you’ll develop a very strong foundation for solving LC problems later so it’s well-worth the mental pain. I would try to aim for fully learning 1 strategy per day which took anywhere from 3-5 hours and there’s around 24 strategies total (Grokking the Coding Interview + Grokking Dynamic Programming). For dynamic programming, there’s a section in Grokking the Coding Interview but I found it confusing and it only contains 1 DP strategy, so I recommend skipping that one and once you’re done GTCI start Grokking Dynamic Programming which explains that strategy better and also has 5 more strategies.

**Step 4: Practice**

At this step, you should know your Python syntax, understand DS&amp;A, understand the ins and outs of each strategy and should be able to come up with the solution in your head to most LC easy’s in 5 minutes and mediums in 10 minutes. The point of this stage is to actually practice the full problem from prompt to code and practice talking out loud (or whisper if you need to be quiet) like you would in an interview. The resource I recommend is Grind 75 grouped by weeks with 70-100 questions total. Go through each question and try to solve it on leetcode. Don’t look at the solution until you’re stuck for 30 minutes, meaning you haven’t made any progress in your logic for 30 minutes, making logical reasoning steps in your head doesn’t count as being stuck. To actually solve a problem, read the prompt, visuals, examples, and input ranges. Start with a brute force and solve how you would do it intuitively, typically this means start on element 0 and perform steps until you reach a solution. Then make logical deductions based on what you’ve been given in the prompt and how your brute force looks (careful, the brute force might be a red herring to the actual optimized solution). Use your logical deductions and match onto a few potential strategies that you think have a high chance of working and investigate how each of those strategies could be used to solve the problem. Sometimes you'll need to combine strategies in series or parallel. If you can’t identify any, just try each of the 24 strategies one by one in your head, even if this fails it’s all good practice for your logical reasoning skills. You can think of the problem solving process as a graph traversal, where you have your starting state as one node and your goal state as another node. You can add strategies as edges onto your starting node to transform the starting state into a new state. Check if the new state is your goal, if not then add another strategy either onto your new state or your original state and repeat until you reach the goal. Once you have the optimal solution in your head, write down your algorithm in comments above the function in 2-4 lines along with the time and space complexity. Writing the algorithm down takes me a minute, but it saves me 5-10 minutes during my implementation as it lets me focus purely on implementing my algorithm into code by referring to the text when I get confused without having to think “what was my algorithm doing at this step again?”. Initially, you’ll probably be slow at implementing the algorithm in code and run into a bunch of Python syntax errors. I’ve spent hours debugging my code in single questions at the start, it’s normal and just use this to learn the quirks of Python. After implementing, I check over my code once for silly mistakes and then run through it with one of the example test cases line-by-line, keeping all the variables in my head (use comments if needed). Then I submit and fix my code if the submission failed. Once the submission passes I go look at the solution (either official or in the comments), try to find “easy-to-understand” and ignore the one liners. If I still don’t understand the algorithm I’ll watch the Neetcode video for it then try to implement it. After around 20 easy’s I started solving them (getting the first optimized code solution which may have syntax bugs) in 15 minutes. After the first 20 mediums I started solving them in 30 minutes. Hards are usually a combination of strategies and some (mostly greedy algorithms) you just need to memorize but there aren't too many and so I can usually solve them in 40 minutes right from my first hard unless I just don’t know the trick. I did 2-4 problems a day (2-5 hours daily) until I hit 50 problems and that was when I felt confident I could solve 80% of the problems on my own in a reasonable time and the remaining problems if I was given a hint or two which is more than interview-ready.

**Bonus step: Maintain your skills:**

Given how common switching jobs is in SWE due to either increasing TC or layoffs/pip/firing, and how interviews in SWE are bottlenecked by LC problems, it makes sense to try to retain your knowledge such that you only need a week or two to prep the next time you interview. I’m planning on doing 1-2 LC problems per week on Sundays which I feel like after all this prep to build a strong foundation and deeply understand the material should be enough to retain my knowledge. My solving speed will probably drop, but I estimate next time I prep I’ll only need to review my notes and do 30 LC questions to get me interview-ready. This will probably only take 2 weeks time instead of months. 1-2 questions per week will only take 1-2 hours per week which is nothing for the reward you get by staying near interview-ready. I’ll have to try it out to see if this is enough, but it seems like it should be.

And that's the end. If you made it this far, try implementing these steps and let me know how it goes. I hope you find similar success that I have found following these steps.

I have a friend who went to a no-name school for undergrad and also got his MBA from a no-name school. He works at a tech company now making $170k+ doing technical sales (plus commission?).

Pay: $47/hour

However, I've been told to be happy with the offer I've received. Should I continue to keep looking for more, better roles? The job search has been tough this season, and I have 14 days to accept this offer.

csMajors,[removed],Do you want to learn Software Quality Assurance from Scratch?
csMajors,"Hey all, for the longest I've been considering switching to a career in computer science, specifically in software engineering. My first exposure to coding was in high school. I had a class where we did some HTML and Java, and I really did well at it and enjoyed it. I haven't really touched it much since, but I have fiddled a bit with FreeCodeCamp and looking up code specifically for an application I use which uses Python. I think so far that it would be a good fit for me, but I'm also afraid.

Concerns: 

My current field is accounting and it's too boring. I just deal with monotonous Excel spreadsheets. I'm not really making anything new happen. I don't feel like I'm contributing to anything.

Maybe this isn't a huge issue since there are workarounds, but I find that sitting down too long in general aggravates my piriformis syndrome. It hurts.

Lastly, I'm in it for the high income potential as well. I know accounting isn't a bad field in this regard over the course of the long-term, but I'm in no way interested in obtaining my CPA and working 50+ hours during busy season.

I'm just having doubts. I don't want to invest in another degree only to find that I face the same problems as I currently am, especially now that I'm in my 30's. 

I am considering attending WGU and think that it'll help with the whole work life balance situation for me. 

I actually already signed up, I'm just getting cold feet I guess. I think knowing how to code and having the ability to fix things is cool. Also having more WFH capabilities too. Plus, I want to provide a better life for my child.","About to go back to school for CS, but I'm having cold feet."

Some details about the other two options:


**Pimco**:
Pros: Pay is substantially better than other offers
Cons: Would not want to work full time, people there seemed boring, I also heard financial industry isn't that great for career? It’s also in Newport Beach which I am not a huge fan of since I’m trans and a bit wary of the culture surrounding the company. (they have a history of discrimination lawsuits 😬😬)


**Walmart**
Pros: Recognizable brand name
Cons: Pay is lowest out of all of them, new grad pays like 20-30k less than Veeva.

I have a decent grade in my cs class, which is basically just a Java course but dives a bit into introduction to algorithms. I don’t necessarily think I am struggling, I understand most of the material (I think) and I wouldn’t really say I don’t enjoy it. It’s always very satisfying when you finally figure something out. However, the assignments cause me immense amounts of anxiety. I start them relatively early and just lose my mind over them because I feel like I am incapable. Next semester I have to take a project based software engineering course I am so worried. I am a determined individual, but lately I’ve been feeling so depressed and like my future is doomed. I regularly check the cs discord for my school and I don’t really think I fit in with anyone and they seem so intelligent. Not saying I don’t believe I am to some degree, but those kids are off the chain. I never have a single clue what they’re talking about. All I know is C (which has been awhile so I kind of forget some of it) Java. I hate to say it but I don’t know if I can carry on with this. I’m sorry to sound so negative, but I have never felt this bad or incapable in my whole life.

Here's why I think I shouldn't apply to internships:



- I am having surgery in July that requires me to stay in the hospital for 1 week and be bed bound for 6 weeks. The internship should have to end before my surgery, and most internships I looked at continue until August 



- I am in a community college. Although I have applied to transfer to a 4-year university to obtain a Bachelorsin Computer Science, which I will be starting next Fall, right now my resume just says I am going for an Associates in Engineering. Most organizations require that I be pursuing a BS in CS, which I am technically not doing right now, although I will be doing next year for sure. So it seems like perhaps I can't apply to most internships?

- If I don't apply this year, that means I will only have one other opportunity to obtain an internship [Junior to Senior year summer]. If I can't get an internship that year, I'm not sure what I should do

Hello everyone I've never posted before so I may not know how a couple of things work but I've made a fairly basic BLE sketch where a central connects consecutively with 2 peripherals, checks the rssi with each of them and then writes a value to the characteristic of the one with the most powerful rssi. My problem is that the bleCharacteristic.writeValue() function is not going through at all and to confirm this I made a while loop at the point where the value should be updated on the peripheral and the program stops there which means that the value is never written in the first place. I have tried to change the value with the BLE app from my phone and it works as it should but it doesn't with the central.

Situation: I just got offered a scholarship from Boeing, which would cover tuition and housing for the next two years. However, to receive it, I also have to agree to two summer internships (paid) and a 3 year contract after I graduate. I don't really like Boeing as a company—seems like they've failed a bunch—and I've heard their work environment isn't the best either. But, the financial security would mean I can relax for the next two years and wouldn't have to worry about mass applying to internships again. The letter of intent is coming in on Monday, so I don't have all the details yet (including salary, which would obviously play a big role lol), but this is the general situation.

Should I take it? Would 5 years of Boeing look weird on my resume or would it be a good starting point for when I *really* start my career? Is this much security bad?

At this point, I've applied to at least 400 jobs (co-ops for Spring and internships for Summer in 2023). I was hoping to at least interview with some top companies (top tech/FAANG companies) for the practice, but I didn't get an OA/interview from any. I did think I had a fair chance though.

I know I started applying late (September), but I know many other students in school who starting applying around the same time and have received offers from companies like Amazon. I've only had 3 interviews, and I was rejected by 1, and I'm waiting on the other 2.

What could I be doing wrong? I thought of a few things

* My resume isn't good. I have posted it on for feedback on this sub and another, but I didn't really get a lot of feedback on the content. My counselor says it's fine too. I do plan on rewriting it to add more details and to try and quantify what I did, but I'll only get to use it when I am applying again next year
* I'm just super unlucky and the this is a bad time to be applying

I just feel really bad at the moment for not getting a co-op yet because more than half of the semester is already over. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've applied to pretty much all the software/data/machine learning jobs on my university's career board, and I'm also applying on linkedin and other job boards.",What are some possible reasons for why I could not be getting interviews?

Zendesk and Apple will release results next week, kinda curious what y'all think.

Apple IS&amp;T - Partner Solutions and Technology Team: 

Everything I've read online tells me to stay far away from this organisation. The role seems more business-like than coding. Still, the Apple Brand name is really hard to turn away from and the people seem nice.

Zendesk - Productivity Tooling Team:

Great internship programme by all accounts. The projects seem really interesting. The only issue is the uncertainty from the company being acquired. Probably the highest chance of an internship offer being rescinded.

PayPal - Digital Wallets Team:

I'll likely be working on Backend stuff. However, the TC for full-time is less than Apple and Zendesk in my country. Not sure if they'll do layoffs soon.

Morgan Stanley - Cybersecurity Division: 

Incredible internship programme and great tech culture. From what I'm told, they're planning to send the interns to New York for a week which I'm quite excited for. Still, it's a bank, and it's not exactly a SWE internship. 

I'm looking at full-time TC as well, and it seems that for salary: Zendesk &gt; Apple IS&amp;T &gt; PayPal &gt; MS. 

P.S: If it helps, I'm based in Singapore, so I'll be interning in the Singapore branch for the above companies. Would greatly appreciate any thoughts on these internships

Implement a function called get\_persons(person\_list , n).   

Parameters:

person\_list (type: list): a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a person in the form of (name, gender)

n (type: int): a positive number (at least 2 or more)  This value is the number of people of the opposite gender ""enclosing"" a person p.

We say that john is enclosed by 3 different members of the opposite gender, namely ann, val and alex, as they surround him on both his left and right side. 

We also say that ann is not enclosed by members of the opposite gender, as val, who is of the same gender as ann, sits directly next to her on one of her sides. 

In general, for a person p to be enclosed in the circular table, there must be some members of the opposite gender of p surrounding p on both his/her sides. 

Expected Output:

Test Case 1

get\_persons(\[('john', 'M'), ('alex', 'F'), ('don', 'M'), ('val', 'F'), ('ann', 'F')\], 2) 

returns \[('john', 'M'), ('alex', 'F'), ('don', 'M')\]. The tuples in the returned list can be in any order.

csMajors,"**Are you an enterprise developer?**

We often come across the term “Enterprise Developers” and even more often, we ask ourselves questions about their profile, from basic demographics to purchasing decisions. But who is an Enterprise Developer? According to SlashData, large enterprise developers as those who work for organisations with between 1,000 and 5,000 employees and very large enterprise developers as those who work for organisations with more than 5,000 employees. Non-enterprise developers are those that remain.

**How many enterprise developers are out there? 🤔**

In Q1 2021, SlashData estimated that there are 1.5M enterprise developers working in large organisations, and 2.0M working in very large enterprises. Between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, there was a 21% year-on-year growth in the large enterprise population, while the very large enterprise population increased by 18%. 📈

This is impressive growth, considering that the non-enterprise population showed only 10% growth over the same period. However, for the large and very large enterprise population, the immediate picture is one of stability: in the last six months, it has remained practically unchanged.

Considering that the biggest tech companies an important proportion of very large enterprises have benefited from the economic situation caused by the pandemic, it is somewhat of a surprise that the very large enterprise population hasn’t increased.Perhaps there is a backlog of hiring splurges that have yet to show up in the data or these companies are remaining cautious and waiting to see how the pandemic plays out before committing to hiring more employees.

csMajors,"Hey all, throwaway for privacy/legal issues. I recently got rejected from a position where I felt that I interviewed very well so I wanted to share/ask some questions.

I'm currently a CS student and was interviewing for a SWE intern position at a pretty big company. I just went through 2 rounds of interviews (after the initial coding screen).

First round they asked 3 questions. 1 Leetcode easy which I solved in &lt;5 minutes (I've seen the question before). 1 Leetcode medium which I got a bit stuck on, but after discussion/explaining my thought process with the engineer, I was able to solve it. The third question was ""just for fun"" (interviewing engineer said usually the 2 questions would take up more time so he's just asking extra questions - this one was more of an open-ended question where I implemented my own class, it sounded like it did everything the interviewer wanted it to do. Left feeling pretty good, but a bit nervous about the trip up on the medium question, but I did end up getting an invite for a 2nd interview.

Second round, they gave me some pre-written code and told me to add some features to it. Everything went pretty well imo, I was able to add every feature that they asked. I even made sure after implementing the feature to run the code and double check with the engineer that it was satisfactory. At no point did I really feel stuck or confused. Again I finished early and the interviewer used that time to ask me about my past experiences. Left this interview feeling super confident.

Fast forward to yesterday, I got an email saying I was rejected. Now, I've been rejected from roles I really want before, so I'm not particularly new to rejections, but for every single one of those, I've left the interview feeling unsure/bad about my performance - usually because I didn't finish or didn't account for all edge cases. But not for this one, I left every interview feeling pretty good, because after all, I solved all their questions, usually this was enough. This one stung a bit more than usual because it was an interview that I felt very very confident about - at no point did the interviewers indicated to me that they were unhappy with my solution or that my solution was wrong or even suboptimal, I was completely under the impression that I did very well. Now perhaps that is on me for being too confident, but to the fact that the interviewer seemed happy with my answer + ending the technical portion early/asking an extra question gave me the feeling that it went well.

My question now is is it worth it to reach out to my interviewer and ask what I did wrong/how I can improve. Another question of mine is that is it possible that my 1st interview was what caused me to get rejected? I was under the impression that if I did poorly on my first interview, they wouldn't schedule a 2nd interview - and the Leetcode med on the first interview was the only question I got semi-stuck on. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I already signed the offer for Tesla as a SWE intern for Spring and Summer, but I recently received an offer for Belden as an R&amp;D intern for the Summer. Both internships are based in the Bay Area. On one hand, Tesla's more intriguing since it's Tesla, 8 months long, and pays a lot more. On the other, Belden's internship is going to let me work with researching tech--something I'm more passionate about. Do y'all have any advice on what to do?",Tesla or Belden

csMajors,"As promised, here is the process. For those of you who remember my dilemma, I ended up turning down Khan Academy. :(

**First Interview - Project Demo (45 mins)**: first, start by talking a bit about yourself; transition into talking about a project you made (and demoing it + code); engineers ask increasingly deep questions about the project; time at the end for questions.

**Second Interview - Technical (60 mins)**: single technical question with several follow-ups; simple ad-hoc with many edge cases. Also time at the end for questions.

**Final Interview - Behavioural (45 mins):** standard behavioural interview, delving deep into past experiences, projects, and passions. Time at the end for questions.

**What do they value?**

They want genuine candidates who adhere to their core values. For me, I heavily emphasized my love of learning and teaching (demonstrated in EdTech project), plus my diverse background (when writing the application). In the first interview, I demoed a project that was somewhat complex but mainly had a high-quality codebase (complete with unit tests, documentation, etc.). I also talked about how it was one of my first projects with the language of choice (again, showing a love of learning).

It felt that they really value culture fit (and I sure felt that I was a culture fit).",Khan Academy Internship Interview Process
csMajors,"Need help determining when to graduate. I go to a T10 CS school and I can basically graduate Spring, Summer, or Winter of 2024 or 2025 (i am class of 2025).

I have heard the return offer for my internship would be around 75k and the median for levels reflects that salary for entry level. 

Should I hypothetically plan to take the return offer, or should i prep for another internship szn?

Company 1: Epic Systems

* TC: 110k base + 15k relocation (after 2 years) + 50k stock
* 2 weeks vacation
* Medium cost of living

Pros:

* Big company which can be good for networking
* Active community 
* Training and educational opportunities
* Higher TC

Cons:

* In office
* Would require relocation
* Worse work life balance

Company 2: Medium sized company

* TC: 86k base + 2k signing bonus + 35k stock
* Low cost of living
* 3.5 weeks vacation
* New office location with about \~30 employees

Pros:

* Hybrid with 2 days wfh
* Relaxed work environment
* More ownership over projects
* Growing company

Cons:

* Lower TC
* Potentially fewer networking opportunities due to smaller office",Need help deciding between job offers

I said how I was sitting next to this realtor who didn't know know her job was going to be replaced by an iPhone app within the decade, and how people could by houses from their smartphones pretty soon. Honestly, I hate people who brag about money. It fucking pisses me off. It made me think about the people in California who struggle to buy houses because of the real estate market. She kinda looked over with a puzzled expression on her face. Her husband came back from the restroom and she explained what happened and he confronted me.

csMajors," I am 35yo, have been out of a job for 2 years. I am in the US now doing a Ms in CS. I have a undegrad degree in Engineering of which I used for only 1 year as an electrical engineer, after which I switched career to manufacturing in a non-tech related supplier facing role. I have been getting huge setback in getting internships for summer 2023, which is required for this degree. Every other coursemate around me is at least getting some call backs, even those with less tech experience than me, whether it be in skills or tech work experience.

I know networking is important for someone my age, but I have none. I am so busy trying to catch up with the others in tech skills that I don't have much time to network. I tried to connect with people through Linkedln and such. Again, I feel extremely insecure because of my age and non-experience which is unusual for people of my age. Maybe recruiters just don't know how to put me in a box. I am neither young nor experienced.

What else can I do?  I thought the fact that I got admitted to this Ms program means I might stand a chance to break into tech but I am not sure if the school is just a scam now lol.

Ps. I am trying to specialize in Java, and developing portfolio that incorporates other stacks, React, CSS, cloud, Python etc. Still building my portfolio. I should say that I just started switching in the beginning of this year. I have catch up to maybe around intermediate level of core Java.",Too old for internship?

csMajors,"I’ve recieved offers for both Cvent and JP Morgan for a Summer 2023 internship.

Cvent is nice because they pay $45/hour and they have a high return rate percentage. The internship is also remote. However, Cvent is not as well known and I’m not sure if they are considered a tech company but they are in the event management field. 

JP Morgan offers a pay of $39/hour but   its not remote so I have to pay for housing, although they give me a stipend that covers most of it. Despite the lower pay, I believe JP Morgan is more well known and looks better on a resume for new grad.

The GS recruiter is asking me to ask for a deadline extension for Mathworks as they need some time to get back with the final decision but given the layoffs and everything that is happening, I am worried about getting my offer rescinded due to any delay.

csMajors,"I attended a career fair today and the best interaction I had was with the vice president of an electrical/construction type company. They only offer electrical engineering internships, and currently they only have one staffed who is about to graduate. I guess that intern is “more on the programming side” according to him? He said as a CS major it’s not necessarily right up my alley but that they would accept any engineering major. Apparently they could use someone with CS knowledge to help advance their software, or at least to guide them in the right direction, because they don’t do much of that themselves. He also said they may want to build an app in the future. I think I really hit it off with him, and he seemed quite eager for me to apply (it was a very genuine interaction, the company/internship is based in the city I’m from so I think that helped). I have no electrical engineering knowledge and I’m not very deep into CS coursework yet tbh, but if I can get into this position and learn from it then I would love to do that.

i have previously passed the first technical interview two weeks ago, and have an interview scheduled for next week. today the recruiter has reached out to me saying that they are cancelling my interview as they are only considering candidates graduating in 2024 or earlier (i’m graduating in 2025). then the recruiter asked if i’m interested in backend roles with other teams at tiktok, and if so, she will help me with matching with other teams. i said yes and thanked her for her help.

If I had read the questions a bit more carefully, I could have gotten a C or B-. I scored full scores on the coding part, but it was the multiple choice questions that killed me.

csMajors,"Some weeks ago, I posted a few questions about Adobe's OA and interviews. I got an offer for a Software Engineer Intern Summer 2023 and I would like to share how the process went starting from my initial application.  


Step 1: Polish up your resume, make it as specific to the role you like as possible because managers review the resumes of people they'd like on their team, so be as specific as possible.  


Step 2: Stalk the Adobe career page for internships and apply at the earliest date possible.   


Step 3: This is the hardest part. If your resume is selected, you will get an online assessment. It's hackerank. 3 leetcode style questions generally.  


Step 4: If you pass the OA, Your resume is reviewed again, and they perform team matching. You will be invited to the Interview Forum where you can have as much as 4 interviews on the same day. You are essentially being matched with different teams. It can be less than 4. I had just 2 interviews with different teams. They mostly talk about your past experiences and ask you basic CS questions depending on your experience.  


Step 5: You get sent a form to fill specifying the team you liked speaking with the most in order of preference, If the Hiring manager likes you, an offer would be extended.   


Note that at Step 4, you already almost guaranteed an offer, so be confident and be calm.   
Also, Adobe hires on a rolling basis, so you can always re-apply if your initial application is taking a long time.

I didn't expect a response. I didn't even remember I applied. Since this was my first technical interview, I completely bombed it.

I currently work part-time during school, and working two jobs, where one isn't paid, doesn't sound very fun. I also don't know if my current job would allow me to do the internship. However, this would be *relevant* experience I can put on my resume.

Summer 2023 is far away, so I don't think I should set this internship in stone because I could get another internship that's actually paid. But I'm scared I'll get no offers. Working for free is something I *hate* doing, but I'm afraid if I reject it and I get no offers, I'm screwed.

What's worse is the job posting didn't specify *when* the internship starts and ends. Just that it's unpaid and remote.

lamps' light.

In other words, you are given a two-dimensional array lamps, where

lamps \[1\] contains information about the ith lamp.

●

●

lamps \[1\]\[0\] is an integer representing the lamp's coordinate;

lamps \[1\]\[1\] is a positive integer representing the lamp's effective

That means that the ith lamp illuminates everything in a range from

lamps \[1\]\[0\] lamps \[1\]\[1\] to lamps\[i\]\[0\] + lamps \[1\]\[1\]

csMajors,"Hi guys,

From SoCal (San Diego).

So basically, I attended CC for a couple years swapped majors a couple times (bio —&gt; jazz performance/MTech) all whilst having zero drive/feeling purposeless and was also going through some rough stuff at the time and that culminated in a really poor gpa. 

I took a gap year and worked a couple jobs while self learning how to code and really fell in love with it. At the tail end of that time period, I decided to meet with a counselor at the CC and create a plan. I decided to start off slow and do well to build my confidence back up and progressively increase difficultly as the semesters have passed. 

Well, It’s been a bit over a year and I wouldn’t even be able to recognize myself from 3 years ago. I’ve had straight A’s, love the material, and have really good relationships with all my profs too. 

So here’s the deal, I can’t stop worrying about competitiveness and I get super stressed and angry with myself because I calculated that even if I get straight A’s till I transfer, I can only climb up to a 3.4 (even with acad. renewal). I even have all my easy GE courses out of the way in addition to some other major specific coursework(the ones I did poorly on (lots of B’s and C’s) so now I’m left with all the tough CS major prep coursework to take simultaneously. 

Currently, it’s not too bad. I’m taking Calc, Java II, and Discrete (expecting 4.0) but worried for next semester. Ok I’m very worried. Im taking Calc II, C++ II, Data Structures, and Physics. Idk if it’s just me who this terrifies but yes I am terrified. The kicker is if I change my schedule or pace financial aide office said I lose my aide so yeah. My next and final semester I’m taking Physics II, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. 

I just feel like my stress of trying to get A’s every semester to bring up my GPA is driving me nuts at this point and only see things getting harder just before I can apply. 

I will be finished with coursework by end of fall next year which leaves me spring semester to work on some fun personal projects/ apply for internships or something? Also not sure if they’d make it onto the application if I apply early. 

Is there any way college admissions officers would see the big difference on my transcript between now and before I returned or maybe see my major prep coursework gpa vs GE gpa?? 

Which universities would you guys recommend I apply to given the situation and (fingers-crossed) 3.4 gpa?  (I have researched averages for accepted transfer GPAs into CS in CA but would still like opinions) 

Pls let me know if you guys have any advice, motivation, study tips for the courses I mentioned, really anything. I feel like while I am looking for advice, I’m also kinda venting while I’m stressed out studying for a Discrete midterm. 

Please feel free to comment in a casual way if you don’t feel like providing any constructive info or even vent yourself about your own experiences. Just talking with people would be nice right now. 

Sorry for the super long post by the way…",Stressed and need realistic advice on how to go about transfer application and where to apply

I’m deciding on whether to accept my offer from Cigna or Emerson, and I’m also currently in the interview process with Dick’s Sporting Goods (Not sure where that’s going, hopeful tho).

I know people are going to say just practice more, and that probably is the answer I know but don’t want to hear, but I feel like for the time I’m putting in I’m not reaping the reward. Should I switch majors or stick it out? I’ve always been able to learn quickly and been a bit more advanced than my peers so it suddenly feels like a train hit me and I’m way behind everyone. The content just seems too fast paced for me to understand thoroughly, and it seems like most of my classmates have been exposed to the material in high school.",How the hell do you catch-up without having coded before college

Now for the majority of this post…

Advice:

to start this off I should probably note that I didn’t have any technical experience coming into college, I was actually gonna major in something like econ or psychology idk. When I decided to make the switch to CS, I was that one dweeb in all my classes who literally felt behind in everything. So you may ask how did I make the progress to where I am now?

the answer to this question is very simple: Leetcode, Leetcode, Leetcode

Let me repeat that again: Leetcode,Leetcode, Leetcode. 


that’s it, simple. keep your head down and focus on leetcode, and it will 99% guarentee you success. now the salty ones will complain and state that because I go to a T10 CS school, I just had an automatic advantage. Idk how else to debunk this other than the fact that my resume in freshman/sophomore year was absolute dog shit. every recruiter I talked to back then advised that I apply for more “business centered roles”. I ignored all of them and just grinded leetcode. the one company that gave me a chance with just an interview was my golden ticket. I knocked all the rounds out of the park because of LEETCODE. I kept my head down and grinded that shit hard until I was given a chance. 

I would say after getting the first internship on the resume it helped a shit ton. from there it became pretty easy to atleast get an interview. my advice for those struggling to get any opportunities right now would be to just put your head down and grind leetcode, that’s it. when this stupid recession is “over”, focus then heavily on the networking and applying. (Note: obviously still apply to jobs now, but make sure to focus on leetcode more imo). to be best prepared after the recession is over, I would want to be a leetcode god. 

that’s it. good luck everyone 👋

I was thinking because i'm a little behind in all of my current classes, I should just focus on the two classes I actually need for the minor and put the other two classes on the side, but I don't know if that would be the best idea because:

1. I don't know if potentially having two F's on my transcript would give on the best representation for any future endeavors of mine. 
2. I have to get a GPA of 2.5 in order to be accepted as a business major.

With a part time internship, school work, LeetCode, personal projects, and internship applications it is fair to say I essentially have existed to do nothing but pursue my career for the past few months and I feel like I will reach a breaking point sooner or later. I hardly take part in hobbies, socialize, or do much else besides work towards a better job.

It also doesn't help that I decided to go to community college first so I feel like so much of my effort is passed to the side just from a glance at my resume and not seeing a B.S. degree.

csMajors,"I'm currently deciding between Stripe and Salesforce SWE internships. I'm a 3rd year right now, but I plan on rerecruiting for a full time just because I'm not necessarily that interested in what either of these companies are doing. Given this year's job market, I think I might have to just go with one of these companies instead of waiting for a company I'm more interested to get back to me. My dream companies would be something along the lines of Snapchat, Spotify, Pinterest, etc (more user facing companies if that makes sense?). Here are the pros and cons of each internship from my perspective, and I would love to hear what anyone else has to say about this.

After housing and benefits are added up, both internships pay just about the same, so that's not the biggest deal to me. 

**Stripe**

Pros: 

* Seems to be a bit more of a prestigious internship so it might add more value to my resume? Correct me if I'm wrong
* Company provides food and more benefits
* Work is more engaging and interesting

Cons:

* Low possibility of a return offer (I heard barely anyone from last year's Stripe intern class got return offers) and considering all the new layoffs, I definitely don't know what the situation will be like this year
* Bad work-life balance, which is something that is very important to me but as long as I'm not working over the typical 9-5, I think I would be okay with it

**Salesforce**

Pros:

* Great work life balance and employees love the company
* More stability that Stripe, much higher chance of a return offer

Cons:

* Adds less value to my resume? Please correct me if I'm wrong
* The work I do is more boring and obselete, at least that's what people tell me. I think this is to be somewhat expected when you work at a large tech company though",Stripe vs Salesforce

csMajors,"I’ve been getting ALOT of dm’s about my experience interviewing for TPM so I’m making a post so everyone can have their questions answered in one place. 

I had no coding questions but I heard that some people did. Honestly it was good. My interviewers were friendly. Most of the time was focused on purely behavioral/ hypothetical questions but it’s not that simple. For instance, I own a small business. One of my behavioral q’s was “tell me about a time you were able to simplify a process” so I talked about how I created a subscription model to eliminate a checkout process for my customers. They dug into that with follow up questions like “How did you land on a subscription model? Did you try out other things first? How did you manage the timeline of rolling out the subscription model? Did you end up prioritizing/deprioritizing certain products/initiatives? if so, how did you decide what to prioritize/deprioritize.. Okay lets walk through a hypothetical. Imagine you’re a PM and there is a problem that can be solved with a specific software. You have two options, buy the software from a 3rd party company or develop the software internally. What would you choose for a short term solution and why? what would you choose for a medium term solution and why? How would you pitch that solution to leadership? What are the 3 most important factors when considering going with a certain solution? (My answer was time, cost, and impact) Everything is structured like a fluid conversation. Resume review questions /behavioral questions end up blending together most of the time. I had 2 product design questions in the last interview of the loop but it wasn’t your typical “design a clock for a blind person”. On one of them I didnt even realize it was a product design question until part way through. They asked me my favorite microsoft product and after I answered, they asked a bunch of follow up questions that mirror those in product design questions and thats when I realized lol so I immediately pivoted and started using a product design framework. I hope this was detailed enough for you all.",My Microsoft interview experience

Has anyone asked to start an internship early? If so, were you successful? I wanted to know the chances of this happening.

My profile/resume: I’m a CIS major at a no-name state school. I own a small business and had a sophomore year internship as a technology consulting intern at a well known firm working under a product owner and a tpm. 

The interviews:
Warner Bros (Discovery) PM: Did assessment and hirevue. Hirevue was all behavioral and product sense. Ghosted. 

Jane Street Business Dev: I originally applied for a PM internship but they decided to move me forward for a Business Dev analyst. I completed the take-home but I withdrew after the resume screen because I wasn’t interested in the role. I have no information on final interviews.

Palantir Deployment Strategist: I withdrew after the phone round due to me deciding the role wasnt for me after some research. I also was turned off by the length of their recruitment process. I have no information on final interviews.

Manstercard PM: Their final interviews were mostly behavioral with a few technical questions about the agile software dev process. There was no coding. They dug into my resume. The interviewers were dull and the pay was abysmal. I declined their offer. 

Oracle PM: this one was weird. I applied for Pm but the recruiter tried to push me through to interviews for a security engineer. I have zero experience in cybersecurity so I asked to be placed back on the Pm track and she agreed. The phone screen seemed rushed. It was ALL behavioral. I was ghosted after phone screen. I have no information on final interviews. 

Expedia PM: I completed the assessment and Hirvue. Hirevue was behavioral and product sense questions. Final interview was behavioral and technical questions (no coding) and a mini case study that was basically a product design question. I got an offer. I’m declining it.

Walmart PM: I completed a personality assessment and passed. Final interviews were behavioral and product sense/design. No coding. I’m declining the offer.

“That” FAANG Business Intelligence Engineer: Final interviews were half behavioral half technical. Hit hard on your LP’s. They also asked easy/medium SQL questions and basic statistics questions. I was rejected after final round.

“That” FAANG again Program Manager: All behavioral and resume review. Like intense resume review. Again hit hard on LP’s. I got an offer. I’m declining.

Google APM: Rejected after resume screen. I have no information on final interviews. 

Google Bold: Received candidate questionnaire but haven’t heard from them since. I have no information on final interviews. 

Microsoft Customer Success: All behavioral and Analytical questions with an intense resume review. This is a customer facing role so much sure all of your answers are customer focused. I declined the offer.

2. **Technical Knowledge**: \~ 25 minutes. You’ll answer a series of questions to help us understand your technical knowledge.
3. **Work preferences &amp; skills**: \~ 10 minutes. You'll answer questions to give us a better sense of your work preferences and technical proficiency.

csMajors,"Freshman in CS here. I've been reading quite a few posts recently from r/cscareerquestions and this sub. With all the layoffs from big tech and market corrections to tech making it so that VC is harder to come by, it caused less open positions than last year (I think, corrct me if I am wrong). I was hoping this tech recession would be done by the time I graduate, but I'm seeing some of you say that it's gonna last 5+ years before it gets better. Some of you are acting like getting a internship let alone a job is a herculean effort only achievable by the beat and brightest.

Am I fucked? The competition has been increasing a lot in recent years, and the number of CS grads has only risen dramatically. I know the demand for skilled engineers is still much higher than supply, but the market for juniors is abysmal I heard, at least for big tech. If it's also abysmal for regular ass joe companies according to this sub then god help me. People are saying that tech is still the best field to get into, although I am starting to have doubts about that.

Clearly lots of companies are sinking right now, especially with big tech. Things are pretty unfortunate, especially for people who've interned at top companies and were looking for return offers.

Lots of people, even those with tons of top-tier internships, are having trouble landing jobs because so few large firms are hiring.

I was doing some research into Unicorns (private companies worth over $1 Billion), and I realized that lots of Unicorns that we talk about on this Subreddit (Databricks, Stripe, Scale AI), are pretty well known and competitive, but I saw that there were a ton more Unicorns that people just haven't heard of, but have valuations just as high.

I thought that this was a simple thing to build, so I scraped some data and built a simple website to help people find a list of Unicorns given the area that they're interested in.

Thinking more about which one would lead to better full-time opportunities, either in terms of looking better on the resume or likelihood of getting a return offer. Would love to just return to where I intern and not have to go through recruiting all over again next year.

Okta pros:

* In Toronto, way closer to home. Don't mind relocating for the summer but would want return offers in Toronto. My other offer is in Vancouver, and I'm worried return offers would be in Vancouver too.
* Seems to have a good culture (at least better than the alternative)
* Way longer and more professional 4-round interview process. Whereas the other offer had one round after OA, interviewer didn't show up first time, and very robotic communications.
* Hires a small handful of interns each year compared to the other company's 10,000+ (but obviously is much smaller). Might look more impressive on the resume for recruiters who know.

Okta cons:

* FAANG - good brand name, whereas many people haven't heard of Okta.
* Alternative has more products and opportunities than Okta, which has only a handful of niche product offerings

csMajors,"I’m not going to sit here and pretend this is a topic that’s brought up all the time, but it does pop up from time to time. 

Affirmative Action is a contentious issue. At the university level, there are valid arguments to be made. But as far as hiring practices in Big Tech, I don’t get how anyone has an issues. 

As far as I know, there are special programs to get women in minorities into tech. Sometimes there’s diversity and inclusion internships which were made for minorities only. Résumés from minorities probably go straight to the top of the pile. 

But I have no issue with any of these. Anyone that pretend sexism and racism isn’t an issue in tech opportunities and in the workplace/school is an idiot. These hardly makeup for the disadvantage that is discrimination. 

Plus, the hardest part of breaking into tech isn’t getting the interview, it’s passing the interview. This year has been an anomaly, with the economy and all the hiring freezes. But typically, and this is especially true after the entry level, it’s not really that hard to just get an interview. I’ve seen no evidence that minorities are given an easier time during the actual interview.

csMajors,"Fair warning, this is going to be long. Now that I’ve chosen an internship for this coming summer, I wanted to make a post about these past few months. Although there are some posts about PM/TPM internships, there isn’t as much information compared to SWE internships. I also wanted to show the Computer Information Systems majors that I know for a fact lurk this sub (cause i do lol) that you can get internships without being a CS major. I also want to show you guys what companies/roles i got interest for as a non-cs major
My background/ resume: I’m a CIS major (junior)  at a no name state school. I have a 3.5 GPA. I transferred from a community college to my state school this fall. I own a small business. I was lucky enough to land a sophomore internship with EY as a technology consultant intern while I was still at community college. I worked under a PM while I was there and used that work experience on my resume to target PM internships this year. I also have some classes I took on my resume (Computer hardware and software architecture, database design and development, communication systems, systems design and analysis etc). I also have a research project on my resume from a class i took at my cc on Human Sexuality. It was a risk putting it on my resume but I thought it might be an interesting talking point and I was right. My interviewers asked me about it alot. 

My interviews: First I would like to say that I’m not a strong coder. I know a bit of python and SQL but that’s it. I don’t know DS&amp;A and I’ve never done a LC question in a language outside of SQL in my life. I also had a return offer from EY.

Palantir Deployment Strategist:  I went through the phone screen and it was ALL behavioral. I withdrew from the process after I figured out more about the role and how LONG their interview process is. I didnt do final interviews.

Jane Street Business Development Analyst: I did the take home assignment (Excel) but I withdrew from the process after phone screen because I honestly wasn’t interested in the role. I originally applied for a PM internship but they decided to move me forward for business dev.

Mastercard PM: The interviews were all behavioral and technical questions (no coding)They grilled me on my resume with an extra focus at my time at EY under the PM. I declined their offer because honestly, their interviewers were very dull and they didnt even seem excited to be working there. Also, the work wasn’t interesting and they pay was LOW. I had a return offer from EY paying more so.

Warner Bros (Discovery) PM: I did the hirevue and assessment but I was ghosted after that. 

Walmart PM: I did a personality assessment and final interviews were Behavioral/ product sense/ design. one question was directly off glassdoor. I declined their offer because I ended up getting the offer I wanted. 

Oracle PM: It was weird, I applied for PM but they wanted to move me forward for a security engineer role even though I have absolutely nothing on my resume related to cyber security. I told the interviewer/recruiter that I wasn’t interested in that role and she agreed to move me back over to PM. I did a phone screen that was rushed. Honestly the interviewer didnt seem to be listening to be at all lol. It was all behavioral. I got ghosted after the phone screen. 

‘That’ FAANG company Program Manager: This isnt a PM role and I knew that. It was all behavioral. Really hit hard on your LP’s because they will grill you on them with follow up questions. They really dig into your resume.  I got an offer but I’m declining it because I got an offer for the role I want. 

‘That’ FAANG company (again) Business Intelligence Engineer: The interviews were half behavioral, half technical. Again, study LP’s. I was also asked Easy/Medium SQL leetcode questions and basic questions about statistics (standard deviations etc). I was rejected after final rounds. 

Expedia PM: I completed an assessment and a Hirevue asking product sense questions. Final interviews were a mix of behavioral/technical (no coding)/ and a case study that was honestly a product design question. They grilled me on my resume. I got an offer. I’m declining it. 

Google Bold: I got the questionnaire but I haven’t heard from them since I submitted it. I’m exhausted after these past few months anyway so I’m withdrawing from the process. 

Google APM: I was rejected after resume screen.

Microsoft Customer Success AND TPM: I’m bunching these together because I went through the process for both of these roles at the same time. Microsoft is SLOWWWW so these processes took months. For customer success, Both the first and final round interviews were ALL behavioral and analytical questions. They are looking for someone who is customer obsessed because the role is customer facing/ post-sales. I got an offer but I declined it because I wanted TPM
For TPM- Mainly behavioral but they do ask alot of analytical, hypothetical, and product sense/design questions. They grilled me on my resume HARD. They care more about your thought process in product design questions than they do about your solution. They want to make sure you can handle ambiguity. I got an offer for TPM. that is the one I’m accepting. 

I know this was long. But maybe it can help someone who’s prepping for interviews. I used cracking the PM book, exponent website/ youtube videos to prepare for my interviews.

Pros:

* SF seems fun
* Large intern groups

* High return offer rate

Cons:

* Not sure about which team I am going to be placed on, but according to the recruiter there will be a team matching process and they will try to match me to a team that aligns with my interests

csMajors,"TL:DR
CS degree takes all my free time and I cant study actually important coding skills.

Im in my second year of CS and I have started to look for internship options. Almost every place requires something I am not familiar with (Node.js, Spring, Angular...).

I really like programming and would like to learn these technologies, but I have to spend almost all my free time studying for classes unrelated to coding. 

Im not saying that I did not learn usefull things, I had classes where we studied (Java, CSS, HTML, Python, architechtures, DBs, algorithms..), but almost half of my classes are math related.

For example, instead of learning what I want and find useful for applying for a job or making projects, I spend almost all my free time studying statistics, probability and mathematical analysis.

csMajors,"I have to wonder if this sub has rotted my brain or if she’s actually just crazy good. 


But basically, exactly what the title says. She applied in bulk in September and received multiple interviews (for full transparency, I would say 4-5 of those were through/at Grace Hopper). She’s a sophomore. During this time I was stressing out doing leetcode problems and not applying - I’m a junior who switched into CS fairly late. 

She received a total of 5 offers, and the top contenders were a very reputable tech company and a very solid bank. In comparison, I have had a few interviews lined up along with a couple tens of rejections. 

I would ask her after each interview how it went and generally she would say it was okay. I remember telling her how I couldn’t grasp DP problems and she didn’t even know what DP was 😭 Her hardest interview was Jane Street where they asked about trees. 

I would say we’re on par in terms of skill and knowledge. We’re really close haha despite how this post may sound but I don’t like to pry, especially with how stressful this process has been for me. But ya, I’ve seen firsthand her coding abilities and she’s just a normal, competent student. So I’m not sure if she’s gotten extremely lucky, I’m the most unfortunate mf ever, or if the LC grind is just overhyped. 

A theory I have is that she’s just a really good communicator. With the few interviews I’ve had, I’ve been rejected at the behavioral stage ://

csMajors,"Writing this post as part-appreciation, part-advisory, part-self-validation. Like many others, I wrote my first line of code in my freshman year. Grew up in a one-income family, only ever been through shitty public schooling, no competitive math background, public uni. Now after 4 semesters, I have various offers most notably from JS, Akuna, Cit/Citsec, and HRT; likely signing HRT over the rest. Wouldn't say I deserve them 100%, but still gonna try to share some insight.

This subreddit is an insane motivator. As a long-time lurker, the usual self-congratulatory post (kinda like this 1) left me happy for my peers but also feeling so inadequate. Every step of the way up, I was never complacent because of this subreddit. Ego and pride can do crazy things for your overall motivation, so for that I'm grateful.

The single most important thing that's helped me through the years is recognizing that recruitment is largely not a meritocracy. The difference between someone who got an offer vs. someone who didn't could be chalked up to having nicer interviewers or easier questions. So many small things that are out of your control can significantly impact your odds (e.g. signing up for an interview on Tuesday instead of Wednesday so you get a shitty, power-tripping interviewer). This is how I was able to convince myself that I'm able to achieve these things in the face of rejection, and dodge all feelings of impostor syndrome. With that being said though, you can lower your variance in interview performance as a result of these outside factors with solid prep, naturally.

My advice focuses primarily on engineering in a quant firm context. The hardest part about all of this is knowing where to focus your time. Everybody has a life outside of school/recruitment, so ensuring that the time you spend with your head in the books is spent optimally is so so important. It's a good feeling and super motivating when you know the things you are doing \*will\* secure future gains (like going to the gym), and not going to waste.

1. Learn C++ ASAP. Python just feels nice and I used it as a crutch for so long, but I can attribute most of my successes to making the switch. The level of complexity on problems as you move up are just more efficiently tackled with C++'s robust STL. For instance, keeping pointers to nodes in a BST would require your own class implementation in Python, but C++ has this baked in. Also, some companies require you to interview in C++, (e.g. HRT, Akuna). A good way to get practice is to just start doing LC or building projects w/ cpp. Start coding by guessing bits of syntax, and correct them as you go along until it becomes natural.

2. Ditch web development. Wasted a solid 6 months on this. One of the biggest misconceptions I had starting out was that most engineers focus exclusively on web development, and that getting a solid footing in web dev would do me wonders for my job prospects. Unless you genuinely have a passion for it and it makes you happy, don't bother with it. I want to say this advice is applicable to big-tech roles too.

3. Learn some basic finance. If you can demonstrate that you understand what different classifications of securities are, basic trading strategy, surface-level understanding of options theory, and show that you're ""genuinely"" interested in finance, it goes a long way to leave a better impression on your interviewers prior to starting your coding questions. Building a rapport before the technical part starts is so important for mental. For both you and your interviewer. People are always biased towards more charismatic candidates, whether they're aware of it or not. (There have been some interviews where I've shit the bed, but moved on anyway -- I want to attribute this to maintaining a good relationship with my interviewer). It's surprising to know how many people fail hiring manager rounds bc they couldn't explain why they wanted to make the switch from tech to finance (other than for money obv).

4. It's been said many times in this subreddit before, but don't sleep on OS, comp arch, graphics, distributed systems. These are all notoriously difficult classes but all give you a better chance at interviewing in high-frequency trading. Naturally, building low-latency systems requires a strong foundation in all the above, save for graphics which just gives you a great command of C++.

5. Replace your projects for more relevant projects in performant languages. Build an orderbook, a simulated market maker, unix-like shell, webserver, or whatever you'd like. There are many tutorials online for all of these things, just make sure you can explain them.

I didn’t want to seem stupid at a FAANG interview. The chat before hand went great. But then the coding. I couldn’t remember Python syntax and had to write a lot of it in pseudo code. It was a mess. I even asked if I could google it and obviously he said no. That interview ended and I was pretty sure that was me doomed. Then I get an email to schedule another call to discuss my results. I was then told at this meeting that I got the internship but due to problems at the branch, the role was no longer available. But since I was eligible for this internship they would try to find me another role elsewhere and I would be given that instead. Is this just the most convoluted  rejection ever?",Weirdest interview experience of my life…

csMajors,"Accepted Amazon a month ago already but just received an offer for Khan Academy. I'm a sophomore, so I still have another year of internships. Also from a mid-tier CS co-op school, so Amazon would actually help my resume decently. Very sad cause Khan Academy actually seems like a cool company to work for (minus lower pay, but it's non-profit).

I'll write about the Khan Academy process in another post since that was missing information in Reddit when I was personally going through the process.

Amazon Pros:

* Seattle, Bezos's Balls.
* High pay + housing stipend (standard 9138/mo + 2400 relo stipend).
* Higher brand name/prestige as big tech, would make future internships much easier to obtain.
* Won't have to renege.
* Already made a LinkedIn post and farmed profile views.

Amazon Cons:

* Probably going to be low-impact work on internal tooling that never sees the light of day.
* Seattle, Bezos's Balls.
* Potential to do boring front-end-only work or do 80hrs in an AWS team (?).

&amp;#x200B;

Khan Academy Pros:

* I would genuinely be making an impact on the world. From my discussions in the interviews, it feels that the intern projects help Khan Academy towards their goal.
* Work seems more fun as well.
* They only take 6 interns per year, so potentially intimate environment? And I'll probably be able to meet Sal Khan.
* Great culture and WLB.
* Aligns better with my profile (my main resume project is EdTech, my main uni club experience is working with non-profits).

Khan Academy Cons:

* Probably riskier in these macroeconomic times.
* Remote. My last internship was remote and it was not that fun.
* Lower pay ($46.15/hr) and no relo stipend (I think).
* Less prestige(?) - likely would be harder to secure future internships.
* Would have to delete Amazon LinkedIn post and pretend it never happened (but at least I can farm more profile views for Khan Academy??)",Renege Amazon for Khan Academy (Summer 2023 Internship)?

I’m taking System Analysis and Design this term and we had to make groups of 3/4 students to complete a class project (designing a system) of ten parts (SSR, Gantt chart, system requirements, use case, DFD, activity diagram, ER diagram, class diagram, system prototype, and a presentation about our fictional system, it’s uses, and the process of making it).

We started by dividing the parts on each student but I want us to at least do the first three steps as a group so - as those parts are the foundation of system we’ll be making. Without a proper understanding of the system, the following 7 steps will be harder to do. But they kept putting it off and delaying that i had to do them myself so we’d have enough time to do the diagrams, prototype, and the presentation.

Now that i have done 3/10 of the project, fairly, i wouldn’t have to be as involved in the following steps, right? I guess not. Because the person who were supposed to do the use case ended up making a use case of an entirely different system. The dumdum copied and pasted a random use case because they don’t even understand what the entire class is even about let alone the project or the fictional system. So i had to do it myself.

Step 5 and 6 went fine as the person who they were assigned to did them with out a fuss or needing me to monitor/review their work. But they legitimately have a full time job and already warned us that they can only work and meet on the weekends so i can’t relay on them much. Now come the next steps? Neither of the other two know how to do them, and both of them used the excuse of “sick family member”, not that i have any remaining trust the dumdum anyways.

So now, here i am, contemplating not including the other two’s named in neither of the project as a whole or the presentation. I’m so fed up with people riding my back to get their degree.","Just another day of me, having to do an entire project by myself, while having 3 other “partners”."
csMajors,"Hi fellow redditors,

I have recently developed and launched an MVP of Confluo app, a task assistant, for getting task recommendations, building skills and network, and keeping your followers apprised.

I came up with this idea during the covid lockdowns when I was learning and doing a lot of new things and I felt others were engaged in other activities but because of the lockdowns we all felt isolated, and no one had an idea on what others were up to. To cope with the situation, many people started hosting virtual study and working sessions on discord, meetup, or zoom, many of which I have also joined. Essentially these sessions put you in a video or audio call that gives you a feeling of accountability as you work with others.

Even though lockdowns are over, the virtual sessions are not. Our work and study have increasingly shifted online. But I feel having to connect through a video or audio call while studying or working is an overkill and doesn't apply to all kinds of activities, such as running, sports or gym. So, I introduced a highlight field in a task that would get shared with others as the task is added to the calendar. IMO, sharing with others the highlights of what you're working on should be enough to build accountability without having to attend a video or audio session.

On the other hand, when it came to managing my tasks and activities, I felt no matter which task management app I used I would stop using it after a while. The problem wasn't that managing tasks through the app was difficult. Rather, the app didn't provide any incentive other than push notifications for me to open it. Opening such apps wasn't a joy. Instead, they demanded certain level of determination and discipline.

As we have an inherent desire to find out what our friends and followers are up to, I think having a feed of highlights shared by others should make the app enjoyable to open and keep it engaging.

Finally, I also wanted to track the skills and the number of hours I have worked, So I also included an option to add skills to each task. As I add a task to the calendar its corresponding skills get added to my profile for the duration of the task.

My current problem is I'm finding it difficult to test it with willing participants and get their thoughts. I have of course shared it with my friends. But being an introvert, I hardly have 10 close friends and family members and not all of them use apps for managing tasks. Nonetheless, a couple of them tested it and gave me some useful feedback which I have already incorporated to simplify parts of it.

Hence, I'm reaching out to you redditors if you would be interested in giving it a try. The app doesn't feature any advertisement and all the features I've mentioned above are completely free as I am not looking to make money, just trying to validate if people would use an app like this. Nor I'm looking to promote the app. I would be happy if just 50-100 people use the app and provide me some direct feedback on their experience rather than 1000s of people without any feedback.

I have programmed it in flutter so it's available on both Android and iOS. If you're interested, please go to [https://confluo.app](https://confluo.app) and give it a go. But more importantly, please DM me your thoughts. Thanks!",Frustrated indie developer looking for willing users to try my app

csMajors,"I have wanted to write this post for a long time, but since I finally got done with recruiting for summer 2023 I decided to finally write this. In this post, I will be telling you how I broke into tech. For context, I went from failing every single Online Assessment to getting offers from multiple medium - big tech companies including FAANG and multiple social media companies (non-FAANG) in a year. While I believe everyone's journey in tech is very different, I do think if someone gets the basics right and works hard enough they can break into tech, and here I will try to summarize all the resources and tips I used to achieve what I wanted to. I gave a friend these tips and he used them to get his dream internship and that too in a recession ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**A bit of background:** I go to a T5 CS school but I am an international student so while I did have some advantages, I had a lot of disadvantages during my job search. Small companies wouldn't hire me so I could not get much experience and big companies wouldn't hire me because I did not have much experience. Breaking this cycle was very very challenging.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started college in the Fall of 2019 as an ECE major but switched to CS before the end of the school year. I took the Data Structures class in the Fall of 2020 and the Algorithms class in the Spring of 2021. While my grades in school were amazing, I struggled with a lot of school assignments and barely made an A. I knew the theory but I barely understood how to apply Data Structures and Algorithms to technical questions and, this ultimately translated into poor interview performance and no internships for two consecutive summers.

&amp;#x200B;

**What changed:** During the summer of 2021, while all my friends were already working at their SWE internships, I did a minimum wage part-time job at my school and spent the rest of the time mainly on leetcode. I started with a pace of 3 questions a day and went up to 10 questions a day. The number of questions depended on the topic I was doing. I am not a genius by any means, and it takes me quite a bit of time to understand a lot of these concepts but I was willing to spend that time. Initially, the easy questions, like valid parenthesis, took me more than 3 hours to understand but it has gotten a lot better and I am currently at about 600 questions with about 150 easy questions, 370 medium questions, and 80 easy questions. I also did some mock interviews with a friend (he is such a GOAT) so I could get constructive feedback which I could use to improve myself. I took a light course load in the Fall 2021 semester and focused on leetcode and recruiting.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how you could get started with leetcode and achieve a similar result:

1.  Learn the very basics of Data Structures. This ([https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/)) seems like a great place to start.
2. As soon as you learn your first Data Structure, do leetcode for that topic and continue learning other data structures.
3. In the interest of time, you can look up the solution after 1 hour of trying.
4. After you do one question do similar questions. Try to draw connections between these questions and apply the concept you just learned.
5. Don't lose hope, leetcode is hard for everyone.
6. Repeat and keep doing it until you understand the data structures well.   


**Here are some lists of questions that I think are good**:

1. [https://neetcode.io/practice](https://neetcode.io/practice)
2. [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=all\\\_rounded&amp;mode=all&amp;weeks=26&amp;hours=15&amp;grouping=none](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=all\_rounded&amp;mode=all&amp;weeks=26&amp;hours=15&amp;grouping=none)
3. https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/

&amp;#x200B;

I did not follow any list when I started. I first did all the topics and once I started getting interviews I did tag questions for the company which enables me to do so many questions. I am not sure if these lists contain the same questions but they do seem to contain some of the best leetcode questions. Go in the following order while completing questions in these lists:

1. Blind 75
2. neetcode 150
3. grind 75
4. sean prashad

Once you finish these lists, do as many questions on leetcode as you can. Try doing at least medium difficulty. As I said above, it is okay to look up solutions as long as you understand why the solution works. I would suggest making a leetcode account so all the progress is in one place. You can also use lintcode to access leetcode premium questions. Some of the best solutions I found on leetcode were in the discuss section (sort by most votes for best results). While I did throw a lot of information here, I understand going through hundreds of questions is not possible for everyone but I highly recommend following the lists I mentioned above. I also suggest joining this discord server if you are recruiting for an internship / new grad job. One more thing, ask people for referrals either from your friends or people on LinkedIn. Maybe it becomes the reason you get your dream job. Please be kind to yourself and the people around you :)

Pros: I’ve used their product before and like it enough, know their name value, heard about great culture, lunch daily

Cons: The remote situation; worried that most people won’t go into office when I’m looking for an in person experience, less comp, a little more of a coasting company

I don't live in Pittsburgh, so I would have to pay for housing, food, gas, etc. if I go with BNY Mellon, but with Progressive I could work from home, so I think it would probably be a similar amount of money in the end (let me know if my thinking here is incorrect). 

I'm also not sure which internship would have more interesting work. I know someone who interned at BNY Mellon, and he said he basically just wrote JUnit tests all summer which doesn't sound that appealing. He did mention that other interns got put on more interesting projects though. I also like the idea of being in person. At the Progressive info session, they said their interns get assigned to a project and then a side project of their choosing, so it sounds like it might be more engaging?

Has anyone interned at either of these two companies for SWE? Any other factors that I should be considering? Any insight is appreciated!

csMajors,"I wanted to post this because I have seen some of the things posted on here about how screwed you will be without internships, grinding LC, and all of that. I started to believe this too and thought there was little chance of me getting a job (May grad). Of course these are good things to do and have, but I think it gets exaggerated on here.   

I went to a recruiting event at my college and ended up having a really good conversation with a recruiter for the company. I sent my application in, took my OA, and then did the phone screen which led to the technical interview. I studied the questions posted on Glassdoor, but ended up getting a different coding question. I answered all the OOP based questions well and had a really good talk with the interviewer. For the coding question, I didn’t pass a single test case and was going back to fix my code when he stopped me. He told me that he was actually just looking to see my thought process and how I went about solving it and that I was on the right track. Anyone I asked told me that since I got the question wrong I was cut and someone even told me I should be embarrassed I didn’t get it.    

Anyways, I end up getting moved to the final round which is supposedly behavioral. Well, they pull out another coding question haha. I did better on this one, but ultimately didn’t quite get it in time. We actually talked through it after he stopped me and I was correct, just had a couple things out of order. Once again, this interviewer also told me that the main thing was my communication skills and thought process. 

A week later I received an offer and this is the company I have wanted to work at since I started college. From reading here and Discord, I had multiple people tell me that there is no shot, so I was really surprised because I had started to believe them lol. They said that they really enjoyed how I went about the problems and communicated clearly. My point in posting this is not to brag or anything close. To the people that feel they have no hope because of internships, LC, or whatever it is - this isn’t true! I don’t see as many people on here talk about the importance of communicating and having good conversation during the interviews. In my head, I was thinking either way I want to have learned something from the devs that interview me and this lead to good vibes during the interview.

Leaving school for work during an economic downturn has negative consequences later in life for socioeconomic status, health, and mortality. In particular, recession graduates have **higher death rates** in midlife, including significantly greater risk of drug overdoses and other so-called “deaths of despair.” It is not certain what causes these effects, but workers beginning their careers in a depressed labor market might get permanently stuck on a downward-shifted economic trajectory or they may adopt unhealthy behaviors.","To anyone graduating in this shitshow, stay strong &lt;3"

I am registering for my last semester, and I only have one kind of fluffy elective left to take, and can optionally add Calc III to complete a math minor.

I didnt have an easy time with Calc I or II, but still pushed through to get As, and have reviewed periodically to keep it fresh. I did a pretty intense review about 9 months ago leading up to taking Physics II last semester. I took Calc I and II 15+ years ago, but still seems to click for me when I go through text books and exercises.

Would it be better to spend more time going through DSA texts and ""grinding leetcode"" to buff up for SWE roles, or would having Calc III and a math minor be useful to convince some grad school that its worth accepting an older adult? Could it come in handy in its own right for SWE roles?

csMajors,"Wrapped up my internship at the rainforest in August with an inclined voted. After ending my internship, I was met by radio silence and emailed ASP asking for an update and got two replies in thread. The first one basically said ASP needed additional time finalizing offers due to changing business needs and to sit tight. Then my recruiter (listed in Graebel) replied with ""Hi. I am truly sorry for the delays. I checked on this for you and your hiring manager didn't uploaded your internship performance evaluation form which delays a final decision. They did log an inclined vote, barring any additional complications (e.g., headcount approvals, immigration restrictions)...""

I unclenched a lot after this because I thought was home free, but this morning, I got blindsided by a rejection email from ASP. I immediately replied and got confirmation later this afternoon that I am not receiving a return offer. After seeing the news about Amazon freezing corporate hiring as of today, I can't help but feel like maybe I got screwed over.

csMajors,Thank you,Anyone know the salary for data scientist intern at Aetna/CVS Health?
csMajors," 

TLDR: The goal is a higher starting salary, BS in CS + MS in CS is easier but both are reasonable

Currently, a freshman majoring in CS with no declared minor or double major. I was planning out all 4 years and I realized I could get a master's on top of my BS in four years. It's just a matter of choosing what to get the master's in. If I choose CS it would not be that difficult since my school allows a lot of overlap when it comes to BS and Graduate requirements. I would have to either overload my schedule or take a couple of courses over the summer (asynchronously or online) but I would be taking less rigorous courses like Humanities. If I choose an MBA it would require more effort since there's a lot less overlap but it's still doable. This leads to the question of which is worth pursuing. I enjoy CS but the priority is getting the highest starting salary possible as a new grad. Which would be more advantageous? Thanks in advance.

Other Possible Information:

\-T100 school - nothing super impressive

\-On full-ride so nothing would be out of pocket (only if I do it in 4 years though)

\-This is all with internships in mind for future summers

For background, I'm a sophomore CS undergrad at a world top 5 uni (not US). I had interned before twice at a medium sized company (that no one of you has heard of), and only really started applying to internships at big companies for next summer.

* Withdrawn: 2
* Ghosted: 5 (includes post-OA)
* Rejected: 6 (includes post-OA)
* Phone interview: 5 (cancelled rest of them after my 2 offers)
* Onsite: 2

csMajors,"State Farm is $28/hr + 2k housing.

Walmart is $30/hr + 3k housing/relocation OR corporate housing.

Both are in Dallas, TX, which I live close to. My plan is to pocket the housing money while living at home and drive ~40 minutes to both offices.

State Farm is hybrid/fully remote, while Walmart is in-person. 

My dilemma is that the drive to State Farm is more manageable due to hybrid/remote status, which means I’ll be able to pocket the housing money. However, Walmart is in-person and a 40 min drive both ways, which likely means I’d pick corporate housing and lose out on pocketing the money.

- Does Walmart have better name value than Stare Farm for resume purposes?

I decided I want to get proper education cause I like CS and I got a scholarship in another country so I went for it but boy am I having second thoughts. The program is bombarding me with artificially difficult stuff like, it's all about solving coding exercises in ridiculously short amounts of time and memorizing syntax for quizes. Almost all professors are trash (with only a few exceptions) so time spent is most lectures feels wasted and I need to use all my time to relearn stuff using other sources. Nobody gets to the heart of the subject, it's just exercise after exercise. If they're teaching a paradigm, for e.g functional programming, it's just going to be straight exercises and no explanation of its foundations and building blocks. Oh and don't get me started on maths, for some fucking reason, there seems to be a tendency to RUN to the next concept. I checked MIT videos and the professors there speak slowly, in a matter that's understandable and help you build intuition. None of that here.

I'm fucking hating this so far but on the other hand I'm hopping it's getting better next semesters.

csMajors,"This is my first recruitment season and i was fortunate enough to make it to the final interview for a company I was really interested in yesterday. The interview was composed of 3 parts: technical, behavior, technical and im pretty sure I aced the first two parts. This was also my first time doing technical interviews. 

After experiencing that third part I feel so dumbfounded and am honestly rethinking my views on the company now. I was lucky enough that the question asked was very simple (actually one I've encountered before so right off the bat I knew of a solution). But as I was typing up my answer the interviewer stopped me because I used a formula he wasn't aware of and basically forced me to restart and implement it another way. This caught me off guard cause I'm 100% sure the way I was answering it didn't violate anything. Also i was told that the point of the technical was to see if I am 1) able to explain my thinking/actions and 2) solve it. Emphasis on explaining my logic. But the interviewer just wouldn't let me code how I felt was right or even hear me out when i tried to explain myself. He would ask me a question and I'd start talking but then he'd just cut me off- sometimes to repeat the same thing I just said. At some point, he even deleted my code to force me to restart, or would give me ""hints"" that would just cause errors and then he'd revert the change and explain it to me as if it was my own actions that caused the mistake.

In the end, I just knew he had a poor judgement of me cause he even shaded me during his closing remarks basically saying I should've just taken his advice to restart without question.

csMajors,"Hi everyone! I got Summer 2023 internship offers from JPMC and Zocdoc. Which of the two do you think would be best? I will be a senior after this internship, so my main priorities are (1) How much will I learn at this internship, from my project, and from other employees? (2) How likely is it for me to receive a return offer, and if I do, would I want to return? (3) As a woman in tech, will I feel safe and welcomed there?

JPMC:

* NYC or Jersey City (most interns will be placed at Jersey City)
* $52.88/hour
* $2500 one-time stipend (no housing provided)
* Hybrid: 3 days required in the office
* 10 weeks
* Heard that full-time return offer rate is pretty high
* My thoughts on it so far: 
   * Pros: 
      * Larger company usually = more stability
      * Higher intern pay (but I've heard there's basically no raise for the return offer new grad pay, which sucks)
      * Better name recognition for when I do full-time recruiting next year
      * Higher full-time return offer rate
   * Cons: 
      * Unsure if I want to work at a bank since engineers aren't prioritized as much
      * Don't like top-down, very corporate formal culture

Zocdoc: a later-stage health-tech startup that is pre-IPO, used to financially not do so well but switched business plans a few years ago and now doing better

* NYC
* $40.96/hr ($7100/mo)
* $5400 one-time stipend (no housing provided)
* Hybrid: 2-3 weeks in the office
* 10 weeks
* 10 SWE interns in total for next year
* 50% full-time return offer rate and the team I return to depends on what I want and what business needs are
* My thoughts on it so far:
   * Pros:
      * Larger scope project since startup
      * I feel more passionate about health tech than finance
      * Better work culture and prioritization of engineers since it's a tech company
   * Cons:
      * Pay is not very high for NYC's cost of living
      * Worser name recognition for when I do full-time recruiting next year 
      * Lower full-time return offer rate 
      * Full-time return offer is stock options and not RSU

I've heard for both the impact of your project and how much you will learn are team-dependent.

Any opinions would be appreciated. Thanks!

I failed again because their comprehensive materials and I can’t put up with 20 hours every week to do homework while having 15 credit hours at school and a part-time job. At the third attempt, I decided to pay a big buck to have a private TA to guide me through this painful process, but my internship keeps me super busy to do anything else on the side. Even I made it to the end but I only grasp 70% of the materials and still couldn’t solve a single graph questions without asking for help. My latest attempt was 3 months ago when I decided to go the traditional way — solving only one problem as the first task daily following the  Neetcode150 list. Unfortunately, 18 credit hours and a part-time internship hit me again. I was too stress out to put my head into solving the problem, I got into the shit hole and take a break from coding challenges. The break now take months and I wanted to give up on Leetcode-type questions. But as an international student, getting into big tech comp secures me sponsorship. I now feel shitty about myself, my ability, and my future plan. It started to give me some mental breakdown. I don’t know how to deal with this. I don’t know if I post something on here would help but I really need to let it out.

FYI, all of my passed interview weren’t involved to any Leetcode-type questions. I had 2 internships and a full-time offer that is too low ball (70k with little compensation). That’s why I keep wanting to try, but I’m too exhausted at the same time.",Feel shitty about myself for keep failing at practicing coding questions

Strategically placed tl;dr: have personal programming exp, am starting CS at uni in 3 months, is working a part-time cs job worth it and manageable? How difficult is getting a cs part time job / internship?
I'm starting my CS degree at a university in South Africa next year in February. I'd like to hear opinions and experiences from fellow CS students / grads who took up a part-time CS-related job during their studies. Below follows a bit of background on my experiences with programming so far.

I've been programming and learning about computers on a software level for quite a few years now, having messed with Javascript when I was 12 or so (didn't get very far at the time). Currently I'm halfway through a medium sized personal Android Studio project using Java, and have some Python experience, as well as 3 years of Delphi from high school (yes, Delphi..). Without sounding full of myself, I think it is of value to note that I score 98% on my practical examinations, so I'm fairly good at what is expected of me at this level, which is honestly stuff I could do 3 years ago..

I'm very enthusiastic about CS, keen to get into the math and theory as well, as I'm always curious about how things work and the problem-solving required to work with software.

As much as university seems exciting now, I know I definitely need some real-world experience to land a good job straight out of university, and I do plan on applying for internships (vacation based, so like a month twice a year) next year already (our academic year is Feb-Dec), but is it possible to work a part-time job / internship during semester months and still manage some shape of a life and spend enough time on my modules?

I recently got an offer for Optum's (United Health Group) Technology Development Program internship for Summer 2023 and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this program and could tell me if it is worth it to take the offer. I have two weeks to get back to them but I also wanted to wait to hear back from other companies that I applied for. They offer options in your work schedule such as remote but I wanted to get out of my hometown and opted to be in-person because I wanted to be in a different environment. 

**If anyone interned there I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me:**

**- Your experience or opinions of the experience**

**- technology stack or projects** 

**- work culture**

**- any intern activities or opportunities to connect or hang out with the team**

&amp;#x200B;

\- NC office at Raleigh if you've worked there, which looks cool as it's in the Bank Of America Tower. It's on Six Forks Road if you want to check it out

I've heard about Optum's chill environment and laid-back culture but wanted more details as I couldn't find much about the NC office and the amenities or facilities it offers. 

It's a healthcare company so I'm not expecting too much with the technology stack.  They use the old Microsoft stack along with AngularJS so some stuff seems outdated in terms of cutting-edge technology. As long as I am learning I can't complain.

For context, I'm a junior CS major.

csMajors,"Super grateful to receive both offers, but I'm really struggling with which one to choose. I'm not sure which career path I'd prefer in terms of SWE vs PM, but I know usually it's difficult to transition to SWE as a PM (but relatively easier the other way around). However in terms of company, Microsoft is much better. Here are the details:

Microsoft TPM

* 8k/month
* Corporate housing provided
* Redmond, WA
* Transportation stipend, free car rental

Amazon SDE

* 9k/month + 1.8k/month for housing
* Arlington, VA

I'm considering the following factors, and if anyone can provide further insight on these it'd be very much appreciated and helpful:

* Company culture/WLB (for FT + internship)
* Prestige (both company + role)
* Return offer rate
* SWE vs PM
* Future career prospects (which one would lead to better career prospects post internship, from what I've heard I believe SWE is better just because there are more SWE jobs and it's easier to transition from SWE to PM rather than the other way around)
* Location for full-time (ideally I'd like to be in New York/California, and I know Microsoft is typically mainly in Redmond but I'm not sure about Amazon)
* Salary (also mainly concerned with FT TC, I'm not sure how different it'd be for Microsoft TPM vs Amazon SDE)

For anyone who interned at Amazon in the past or has any insight, would it be possible to defer my offer from summer to fall or winter? I know they typically don't allow it but I've heard of certain situations where people were able to.

I already have my US green card, i would be moving there soon. I am a pretty good javascript(MERN) programmer and have some projects , however i know how competitive the job market is. I have no prior industry experience as a software engineer. I am obviously open to gaining that first trash junior developer job just so that i could have something to potentially put on my resume and gain some experience, however my parents want me to pursue a masters degree because they feel i would have a better chance to get a good starting salary (they seem to think that i can just start making 3 figures). i’m not that naive to think that a company would pay someone with no experience very high just cause he has a masters degree, been trying to tell them for a long time that company’s prefer working experience to a masters degree. so i came here to get opinions.

1.)  As an international student with a degree from a nigerian school, would companies not take my B.sc seriously just because it’s not from an american school?

2.) would a master’s degree help me stand out to employers when i’m job searching? (even tho the recruiter required only a B.sc)

3.) would it be wise to start the masters programme while still job searching and then leave the programme if i find a reasonable job or would it be wiser to continue developing my programming skills till i find a reasonable job or a junior level position?

4.) if i don’t have industry experience but i’ve built many real-world based personal projects over the course of about two years. should i still be applying for junior positions due to my lack of industry experience or should i apply to mid level jobs?",I have a Bs.c in software engineering and i’m moving to the US. should i get a masters degree in computer science?

csMajors,"Sorry this is so long! I just really need to get this off my chest, and I included a TL;DR below! I am currently a sophomore taking 18 credits this semester, alongside a full-time internship at a well-paying unicorn and significant involvement in university project teams/organizations. Since I wasn't allowed to take the semester off due to the requirements of one of my degrees, the company allowed me to work around my class schedule while still working 40 hours a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

I only have 6 weeks left of the internship, including this week, and my design doc just got approved for me to start on my project. I really like the project and team, and am learning a lot, but it's a full-stack project and is taking me a lot of time to learn all of the different components, so I'm worried I won't be able to pull everything together in time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to my manager today, and apparently he didn't realize I was a sophomore who has only finished up till Data Structures and Algorithms and he thought I was a junior/senior who had taken advanced electives in Databases, Web Systems, etc. when he assigned me to the team/project. He then said that the company moves very quickly, and they don't have time for ""hand-holding"" and explaining a lot of things. My mentor and I only meet once a week, and it's hard to check in with them about my questions too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have a good internship already lined up for the summer, for which I didn't have my current company on my resume, so I'm not really interested in getting a return offer. Even though I'm liking the tech I'm working with, I'm feeling a bit burnt out and unmotivated because I know that I don't need the return offer, I'm not able to implement the tools as quickly as they want me too, I have coursework and project teams on my plate which I need to prioritize so that I don't fall behind, and my manager was expecting someone who already took courses on databases, web systems, etc. and didn't know that I'm not there yet.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My internship project is cool but I don't know anything, have a lot on my plate, and my manager was expecting someone with a lot more experience and doesn't want to have to explain stuff to me, which is fair. Since I have a better summer internship already, I'm not that interested in a return offer.

csMajors,"I worked at m@zon last summer and had a very mediocre time. It definitely wasn’t bad, but I didn’t love it. For the most part, I think this is how the average m@zon intern feels about m@zon, though.

Pros:

Had a VERY good work-life balance (a lot of life and not a lot of working)

Stable guarantee of a return offer (especially for full time next year)

Cons:

Didn’t get any free food or in-office amenities (I’m the kind of person that this means a lot to me)

Not very interested in what my team was doing

The way my manager acted towards the team and me definitely rubbed me the wrong way

Could not see myself working therefull time

I’m currently deciding between m@zon and Stripe for next year. My goal this year was to not work for m@zon, but given the current industry situation, it’s been tough getting offers. My current options are to keep m@zon and keep recruiting, or accept Stripe. If I keep m@zon and keep recruiting, in the worst case, I have to work for m@zon again so that’s 2 years of m@zon on my resume that might hurt my chances when I re-recruit for full time. I also am very unsure if companies are still hiring and if I will be able to secure another offer at another company at this point. My main reservation behind choosing Stripe is that I hear Stripe has a terrible work-life balance which is important to me. Is this the case for the interns as well? I also heard Stripe doesn’t give out a lot of return offers and that also worries me. I’m not necessarily that interested in fin-tech so honestly I probably will be just as uninterested in what my team is doing at Stripe as I am at m@zon, but at this point just kind of trying to make the best decision for my future.

I’ll start by saying this: It is entirely my fault that I haven’t been putting as much effort into my CS degree as I should have. I started attending university in 2020 for a 4 year CS degree and I worked just hard enough so I could pass my classes with decent grades. However, I did not put as much effort into actually LEARNING outside of my courses as I should have. And now I’m in my 3rd year and suddenly had an eye opening moment that made me want to learn everything from scratch because my basics are not as solid as they should be.

csMajors,"Hey guys,   


I recently accepted a job offer, about a month and a half ago. And I've been kind of tweedling my thumbs since. I haven't really heard back from them regarding legal next steps. I'm just waiting and doing school. People from the company have reached out via linkedin and sent me books.. and had some emails back and forth, but that's about it.  


I was wondering, is there anything else I should be mindful of? Do I just wait until the next word comes? Or should I be taking some active action? It's my first time being in a ""New Grad"" position.   


I start in July of next year, for reference.  


Thank you guys.",What do you do after accepting a job offer?
csMajors,"Hi Reddit friends, I’m really grateful to share that I have offers from both LinkedIn and Figma for a Summer 2023 SWE internship. With these in mind, I am not sure which one I want to do this upcoming summer. As a junior, I am looking to hopefully return full-time to the company that I choose. Here are some thoughts I formed supporting each. 

Figma (San Francisco):

* Cooler/more fun product
* In the heart of SF 
* Smaller size -&gt; more impact and growth

LinkedIn (Sunnyvale):

* More widely used product
* Intern corporate housing available
* More established -&gt; job stability 

I’m putting out a poll but please comment with thoughts on which would be a better opportunity for a young developer. 

Keeping in mind the state of the economy, does anyone have any insights on future company growth/success?

csMajors,"Just wanted to share how I’m feeling rn. I’m mentally exhausted with job applications for grad schemes. Previously, companies separated assessments like situational test, video interview and coding test so you only do the next one if you pass the previous stage. Now, they make you do all of them immediately after you’ve submitted your online application. I’m spending every weekend completing all these assessments and whenever I receive a rejection, I just gotta sweep it aside and hustle for the next one. 

This time last year I was in the exact spot applying for a placement role. I hustled so much and submitted hundreds of applications. I’m really thankful to get 3 offers and currently doing my placement at a company I love. However, now I’m just drained because this time I need to find a sponsorship as an international student and the application process is getting more tedious. 

I’d rather be rejected from the beginning if the recruiter feels my cv is not good enough instead of spending hours on mandatory assessments only to be rejected with no feedback. Companies say it’ll only take 120 mins for their assessments, but do they know that preparing for those recorded video interviews takes hours of research and practice?

I recently switched my major and I will be starting courses this upcoming spring and should be graduating next fall with a BA in CS and then would be heading on to start my BS in CS, the following spring at an university. My question is that what should I do currently in school and at home to prep myself for becoming a SWE. I've always been pretty good at math so the upcoming courses don't phase me. My first major specific class is Intro to C++ and I have been practicing learning Javascript with Khan academy  with plans to eventually learn Python and Java. I may possibly have an IT internship with my school this spring and have  another internship the up and coming summer. I've also read that I should start some of my own projects as well (but I am fairly new to learning languages) Thanks for your time.",CS Class Life advice needed...

Plano TX

90K Salary

10K sign on bonus

IDK if theres stock stuff or other comp

In person :(

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short, I've been at the end of my rope since Fall 2019. Absolutely non-stop work, school, life problems. I am tired mann. I've worked my rear off for years and am now just wanting a job that will pay me well, give me good work life balance, and really really want remote flexibility. It's not just that I wanna work in my underwear, but I genuinely need/want to be at home taking care for family who NEED me. Being able to work remotely a part of the week would mean a lot to me. 

That said, I've done some basic research about JPMC as a whole. I don't like what I'm seeing. A lot of corporate bullshit, hard to get stuff done, long hours, employee tracking, personally the CEO comes off as very ""I own you"" to me. Salaries are underwhelming (I really wanted 100K minimum) and I was looking forward to getting $$$ in stock options but I don't see much about that

Apparently JPMC sets you up well for better opportunities at other companies in the future but I'm not sure how much I care for that right now. I've already been working ""towards my future"" for years. I've sacrificed so much, so much time, my friendships holding on by a thread, and now the thought of going straight from college to professional work? I want to have time for my hobbies finally, I want to spend time with my family, go out with friends, enjoy a moment to myself, but I feel like JPMC is ready to suck the life out of me. I have been waking up thinking about work, grinding all day, and going to bed thinking about work for years. I've solved homework/lab problems in my DREAMS for fucks sake

Should I tough it out? Im going to my school's career center to see what they think about negotiating the offer, but I wanna see what you guys think. I'm tired of being miserable thanks to school, I cannot keep suffering in professional industry too. I am already at my breaking point

If any of you have heard anything about JPMC Plano, let me know

csMajors,"I'm a freelance proofreader. A lot of people publish on Amazon Kindle and such, not through traditional publishers. As such, they may not have editors or proofreaders, which leads to a lot of mistakes in their books. Typos, grammatical mistakes, missing words in a sentence, extra words (i.e. repeating a phrase twice in a row by accident), continuity errors in a book, etc.

I help with that, and because it's my side gig I only choose to take on clients whose books I actually enjoy. If I think your book is really bad, then I'm not going to do it. So far I've only been doing fantasy and sci-fi because that's what I enjoy and am familiar with.

I charge around $200-$300 per book, depending on the length (I charge per word). And those are low rates, as I haven't been doing it for that long. Experienced editors can charge double or even more.

As to how I got into it - I just started reading a lot of books on Kindle Unlimited and such, and realized there were a lot of already-published books with errors. I figured there would be some demand for an affordable editor.

But, you have to be very good at noticing mistakes, have an excellent grasp of English and all sorts of obscure grammatical rules, and be a fast reader/typer. Most people aren't all of these. If you're slow, then your hourly rate will be bad. A good memory helps too, for catching consistency issues or continuity errors.

csMajors,"It's just impossible to get an internship rn.

I'm a junior in college right now but I transferred from CC, so my knowledge is nowhere close to my peers, causing me to perform ""average"" (if not below) in most of my OA's (mid/low 700 scores in CodeSignal). This is no where close enough to even get a phone call back in this year's competitive economy. 

I've applied to like 100 companies and probably got \~15 OA's back, but I've been ghosted after all of them. I don't think my resume is a problem because I asked a few peers, including one at a FAANG, and they said it was fine. (And yes, I asked this person for a referral, and got rejected from that company too). 

The obvious answer is for me to grind LeetCode and self-study, but university takes up almost all of my time, and by the time I get home after a long day I just want to sit in bed. I don't even have time to exercise. This [rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y9ks9i/rant_about_attending_a_good_cs_school/) of someone who goes to my school summarizes it pretty well.

It's already November, and there are barely any companies left for me to even apply to, and even if I apply to like 100 more companies I'll probably fail the OA's because it's just not feasible for me to study hundreds of LC problems rn. 

I'm probably just going to sit in a dark room all Summer playing video games. :/

Thankfully, I had made a few commits beforehand, and after about an hour of research and trying things out, I found a way to get to a commit that had most of my progress.

For some previous background on me, I go to a T30 CS school and currently a 3rd year student. I had zero SWE intern experience (had 2 previous tech related internship), basic projects, and very surface level understanding of CS topics.  Only thing I had going for me was good GPA and 400 LC (grinded over 80 days). I applied to 200+ places late September and only received rejections for the first month. I was defeated and was at the lowest point in my life. Felt I wasn’t good enough and was about to give up. But I kept going and rolled with the punches. Just this last weekend, I was able to get my dream position and I never felt more proud of myself. 

Trust me. Keep going. You’ll make it eventually as long as you don’t stop now.

For clarification:

1st internship runs Jan - March 2023 and is Malware Analyst. It is very stable even in this economy thanks to it being government related and necessary. Which in this economy, looks very nice/makes me lean more towards this one.

2nd internship runs June - Aug 2023 and is software engineering for a cloud marketplace company that does way more cutting edge actual software engineering. I would learn more engineering type skills and it would look better on my resume but I kind of doubt return offers will even be much of a thing considering the economy and it’s a relatively new company. 

Being a malware analyst, I will be extensively analyzing code just not coding anything myself. Which makes me feel meh but I’m also really excited about it regardless especially to be working with international law enforcement and the FBI. But the 2nd internship is more in my playing field and might look better. 

Technically, I could accept both since they don’t overlap, but my real concern here is what if the malware analyst internship offers me a full time job afterwards. The person who interviewed me basically said they give all their candidates return offers and they are always available, which was music to my ears in this economy. But if I already have the 2nd internship then I can’t take it and it’ll look bad if I cancel on the 2nd one and the interviewer said that’s their biggest pet peeve; ppl who back out, they want our answer to be final and binding basically. Not sure what to do here as they are both good opportunities in their own way. I haven’t given any answers to either yet.

Note: I feel like the only way I somehow got these offers was cause I started applying to smaller/more niche companies early on when everyone was aiming for FAANG and other exciting startups in my area. Somehow me doubting my skills/having imposter syndrome helped me here lol",Is accepting 2 internships bad?

Even though I solved 300 problems over the year, wasn’t passing any phone interview. The current economic situation and the fact that I’m an international made it more difficult for me. 

From August 2020 I started my job hunting process. Applied on more than 500 positions for Summer’22 internship. Didn’t get any offer after just 2 virtual on-site. I kept grinding whole summer. 

Again started the full-time hunting, but this time I was more prepared and more confident. And very soon every hope was going away as I kept failing phone interviews. Some rejections were so brutal to digest. I know lots of people have felt this way at some point. 

Anyway, after seeing all the suggestions and motivation from the previous post I decided not to beat myself anymore over m a job. I was still applying like crazy but wasn’t getting more interviews due to the hiring freeze and economy.

Currently a new grad so just applying to whatever companies as usual, and I got contacted by a third-party recruiter on LinkedIn about two Java positions, the first one, the recruiter mistakenly sent a Mercedes Benz exhaust showcase video as the link to the video introduction of the company (🚩). I gone through the documents, the pay for both are average/below-average for new-grads in the country, and I actually had a couple interviews that have been going pretty well and had offered more money at that point, but I thought more interviews doesn't hurt, so I responded that I'm interested in both.

No idea what happened to the first company, but he did arranged an interview to the second company, it's a small local company that has a semi-monopoly in a few fields in finance and insurance because of local regulations, and their entire tech stack is just Java with JSP and Java Servlet (🚩). Which doesn't sound pleasant but the recruiter also told me that the interview is a single round taking roughly 2 hours, so I thought why not proceed with it.

And then I was told that, the interview will consists of the usual behavior interviews, and a written test about Java with both code and theory. Yes, the interview expect you to handwrite Java code and SQL Queries. (🚩) I thought it's only one round, it will be a pain in the ass but whatever. The recruiter also told me that he will send an email over later with some tips about the interview, which was very nice of him.

Later I received the email from the recruiter and saw the ""tips"" that I was given, which is actually not the tips but just straight up the entire question sheets they will be asking me on the interview (🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩). I was just speechless by this point, he also made sure to mention that ""in order to avoid suspicion, do not score perfectly in the test"". I was flabbergasted and was not sure if this was part of the process of testing my integrity or not.

The day of the interview came, I went to the office, and was just given the test sheet and told to fill it in in the meeting room, and what do you know, its the exact same questionnaire that the recruiter gave me, I did looked up the answers beforehand but decide against just writing down all of it, instead fill in all the sections that I genuinely would have know if I went in blind and leave the rest as blank. During the behavior interviews (which was very straightforward) my mind just went blank and couldn't ask the interviewer any good questions during Q&amp;A as I was just shocked by the whole experience. And I kinda stopped giving a shit about the position and didn't told the interviewer the truth.

Even then, and this may be the wrong approach but, it's hard to find ""the bottom"" so to speak.

I found  several logic errors in the coding challenge they gave me, they seemed  to appreciate that except for one guy in the interview who was visibly  annoyed with me. The other people in the interview genuinely appreciated  the suggestions I offered. At least I thought so. So, after all this  work, they brought me to their headquarters. I spent a whole day meeting  people and answering questions. They even let me see a secret project  they were working on. They want to deliver packages in partnership with  garbage trucks: it's really pretty smart because those trucks go all  over town and they have lots of unused space. Anyway, they showed me  this secret project and I made a few suggestions like applying a  modified version of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm parallelized  along orthogonal hypercubes. I demonstrated how they could avoid the  duplicate semaphore induction problem while delivering even more  packages than they initially projected. It was great.

Well,  after all that, they never even made me an offer. They just sent me a  generic rejection letter. I asked my recruiter for feedback. She said I  was too smart. Too smart? How can that be? She said I made all the other  developers feel inferior and they didn't want to work with me because of that. And one of the interviewers said I had bad breath, but I think I  can sue them for illegal discrimination on that. I'll keep everyone posted.",Couldn't get an offer because I'm too smart

I am a second year CS student currently taking Discrete Math along with some other CS courses and calc 3. 

I know that Discrete Math will be the class I will likely perform the worst in, even though I am planning to spend a few hours every day on this class until finals. We are learning about combinatorics and to be honest I am a little confused, but I think I can grasp certain topics within the chapter. To be honest though my main worry is writing proofs for exams and assignments. I have never been exposed to proof writing before this class, so this new logical way of thinking will take some getting used to for me. I feel like I get stuck on the proofs pretty quickly, and I really don’t want to just search the answer up. I also feel like sometimes Im in class and the professor writes the steps to prove a theorem in class, and I think, “how did he know to go from step A to B? I would have never ever thought of that.” 

I am planning to try to do hopefully some practice every evening, writing a few proofs or at least trying to tackle them.

csMajors,"CS is my third major. It is the one I wanted to do originally, but I thought I was too dumb. Now I have transferred to a cheaper school with a good CS program that I can commute to since I will be graduating late. My favorite class currently is data structures and I love the professor. I love my computer organization + assembly class as well, also taught by a great professor. I am taking an SQL class which is a lot harder than I thought, but overall it feels great to solve problems whether it be circuitry, assembly, C++, or SQL (my other classes are not very difficult or noteworthy)

Still. I had an internship over the summer and I hated it. You would think I would have enjoyed it so much. I was making $15 an hour, working for a respected on the rise company, it was remote. The thing is I just hated it so much. I was isolated from the other interns doing web development. I was using JS, angularjs (not angular, literally angularJS), C#, html, CSS. In theory I should have enjoyed it so much. The thing is the vibes were terrible despite everyone being very nice. I did not put forth the greatest effort as I did not really enjoy the work I was doing. For some reason angularJS was very hard for me to figure out. To give credit to myself they said I exceeded expectations and invited me back, but I declined.

My favorite part was probably making a working email form.

After my internship I dread the future. I can't imagine having to deal with clients, having to be on tight deadlines, having a manger and dev team to constantly report to. I don't know what I would do if I can't figure something out. I want my job to be stress-free

That being said, I guess this is more of a rant post, but has anyone shared similar feelings? Loving their classes, but hating the future? If I had a choice I would do something relating to CS and fish, as I am an aquarist and I love doing that. Is there a pathway for mixing CS and research of nature? Specifically of the aquatic kind?

For context, I had to to drop a class and add a new one in order to fulfill the requirement of having full time credit hours. I asked my advisor what class I should take after giving him my schedule, and he recommended
this cybersecurity class and said while it doesn’t count towards my major it is a good subject to learn about and will fulfill all my needs. So I enrolled in the class. I was not able to find out I needed to know about UNIX/LINUX systems until the class started because the UNIX class isn’t set as an actual prerequisite for the class even though it seems like I need to know it. I can’t drop the class and get a W and also lose financial aid so that is not an option. Below I will give an example of a question so you can gauge what I’m dealing with.

TL;DR:

Just starting my comp sci degree. Advisor scheduled a class that I need to know some level of UNIX to solve some problems without telling me I needed to. Can’t drop the class, will lose money and fail. Where can I start to at least learn the bare minimum to be in this class?

Idk if its important on how to rewrite a resume or application but I have 5 years of experience as an army medic and 2 years of experience working as a nurse (LVN) prior to switching career paths and trying to become a developer. 

Overall, I get little support from my school programs and professors, so I want to be proactive about my future. My programming course has taught me the very basics in C++ such as functions, loops, branches, and arrays/vectors. It's all been coming to me fairly quickly and I can usually solve labs in class without too many problems. (though I use internet resources to get ideas of how to solve problems) 

I'm unsure how to translate these skills into something that I can put on a resume or how to even begin to start the process of bettering myself. All the labs that I have done are through an imbedded coding tool via ZyBooks, so I feel like I don't really quite know where to go from here.

csMajors,"I am an American-Israel dual citizen. I grew up my first 10 years of my life in America before moving to Israel. When I graduated high school, without going into to much detail, I joined a pretty reputable signal intelligence unit in the IDF that involved a lot of IT and programming skills for 3 years. 

I am now on the verge of leaving, and I have an offer to work as a Security Consultant at one of the top cybersecurity companies in Israel, in addition to several offers at other firms (one is FAANG, but it isn't an SWE role, more like an IT-related security role). 

My main issue with these roles, though, is that they aren't directly related to what I want to do. I want to be a software engineer - most of these roles, while still technical, are definitely closer to the IT/IT-security side than the actual programming and software development side.

At the same time, I am applying to several different universities in both Israel and the United States. With my test scores + grades in high school + military service in the IDF (not to mention the fact that I'm not an international student as I am a US citizen), I am confident that I can get into pretty good universities in computer science in both countries.

So, my question is, what kind of career path should I take. I see three options:

1) Forget college. Go directly into the work force as a security consultant.

2) Forget work. Go directly into college - either in Israel or America.

3) A combination of both - my friends suggested I work as a Security Consultant for a few years before going to college.

Any ideas on what I should do?","Have offers from FAANG-tier companies in Israel w/out a college degree. Should I take it, go to college, or do both?"
csMajors,"Okay Im aware that I sound dumb here but please hear me out. 

Some background: 
I go to a school with a 12 month coop program and this extends my degree by one year. So I'm in third year but I'm class of 2025.  Because I've already registered a coop in January, I literally could not graduate earlier than May 2025. 

What happened:

A recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn about a job with Microsoft, it's EXPLORE intern position. Now, I had never heard of it and she said it was a cool opportunity to explore both SWE and PM and for people graduating from 2025 to 2026. I messaged one person from my school on LinkedIn and she said that most interns come back as either regular SWE or PM the summer after and I assumed that's why they care about grad date. I was excited because I love the idea and applied. I entered all my info truthfully, that I started school in 2020 and will graduate in 2025 and was able to pass both rounds and get an offer. Yay! 

But here's the thing, after I joined the msft discord I realized that most people there don't understand the idea of coop (it's not a gap year, I would be registered as a full time student) because it's a Canadian thing? And they told me that I should be wary because they are doing a background check and may think I was dishonest because I'm not a second year student. I should state that I literally spoke 1:1 with a (FB) recruiter and told them I'm in third year BUT graduating in 2025 and he later recommended Facebook university to me bc he just cares about grad date. Also my school would verify my expected grad date as 2025. I always state 2025 because most companies want to know when you can come back as a full time new grad, so it's an honest answer. So I made some assumptions but yeah, the idiocy was not clarifying sooner (tbh I didn't think I'd even get to the first round) 


Now I feel like an idiot and I am very strongly thinking of messaging my recruiter explaining this situation because the last thing I want is to fail a background check in like March and then have no summer coop. I do not wish to be dishonest, but I also genuinely thought that if a recruiter is in my DMs and I never lied on my application or during my interview (there are Literally 2 summer internships on my resume that I spoke about at length???) that I should be ok. I have no worries about the rest of my background check, my GPA and all jobs are real and paid positions. 

Basically I'm pretty bummed but if I'm going to get the offer rescinded I'd rather know now so I can accept other roles. 

What would y'all do? I know I'm in a unique situation but I feel like I made a mistake at *least* by not clarifying earlier. I swear I've been so overwhelmed with applying to over 200 jobs, 20+ interviews this past month, 6 classes and a part time job. I genuinely didn't think too much about it.

csMajors,"To get right to the point: in technical interviews, there is so much more to them than knowing how to solve the leetcode-style questions they inevitably ask you. In fact, I might argue that your general attitude and vibes you give off with the interviewer are more important. Being specific: I just completed two final-round technical interviews with Microsoft this past Monday. I won't specify the questions I got (that would make my entire argument here pointless), but there were \~10 high-level technical questions in the first one, and then 20 mins at the end to do an LC medium. I didn't solve the question or optimize my solution. Next interview, BAM, 5 OOP questions I literally knew nothing about. But I was candid about being clueless and we both were laughing and vibing about it. Then he asked the LC Medium final question, which I literally blanked on. Legit, he held my hand through 20 mins of stumbling through the code. I immediately was like, I'm fucked. I should've prepped more. I see people on this sub saying the interviews are easy but hard for me. I'm incompetent. The works. But I kept my cool, and after our allotted time, we talked for 15 mins about what we both enjoy about being in an office and the interactions that come with it, as well as why he likes Microsoft, etc. I left the interview feeling awful in that I failed it, but good in that I vibed with the interviewer. I ended up getting accepted yesterday, and I was genuinely shocked. Not here to brag at all, but if I didn't get it, my entire argument would be false anyhow. My entire point is, relax, you won't be able to memorize the 2,000+ LC problems, or know all the patterns for every data structure perfectly, you just won't. And even if you do, it's not about just knocking the problem out of the park.

First of all, majority of people, especially in this recruiting cycle would kill to be in my position. I understand that. I'm grateful for all the luck and opportunities I have received.

Onto the rant. I was able to land the SDE internship (not propel) at the rainforest as a freshman (i'm now a sophomore) from a no-name university. When I got the offer, I expected that I would use it to land a ""better"" internship. The word ""better"" is obviously subjective, but you get the idea. In my mind, I would leverage this as a freshman to its full potential. The ideal path that I pictured was rainforest -&gt; Google/Netflix -&gt; HFT of some sort. 

**Denial**

Fun story of how I even applied to rainforest. I was told that I stand no chance as a freshman, I was rejected from all the freshmen specific programs so, I decided to get at least an unpaid internship. Applied to around \~20 on angel list, got a message to schedule an interview; I took it. Day of the interview comes, no show from interviewer. I'm sitting there, in the room, fucking speechless, no other way to describe it. So, I said fuck it, went on Indeed, and started browsing internships. On around the 2nd page, I saw rainforest; I applied. And around a week later, at the dentist office, I received the email for the OA. You have no idea how hyped I was. It's indescribable. For the next \~2 months, non-stop, I was grinding leetcode. Got to the interview, passed it.

**Anger** 

It was around December, so I stopped grinding leetcode completely. I expected that I'd pick it back up closer to the recruiting season in April/May. And I didn't. I tried to do it while I was doing the internship, couldn't do it. I had immense guilt for wasting so much time. Even though I did well at the internship and got the return offer.

 **Bargaining** 

End of October, still not much leetcode progress. Majority of people outside of this sub would totally be cool with it. Majority of people in this sub would probably not be. Do I care? Not really. Maybe I just adapted the same mentality. I can see myself achieving much greater things, like the plan described in the beginning. Is rainforest bad? No. $10k a month for an intern? Fully remote? Amazing team? Sign me up. 

**Depression** 

What's the point of this post? It's just me feeling guilty about my choices. I do well in classes, go to the gym, play soccer, and video games. Do I enjoy doing those things? Yes. Do I feel insane guilt every day because I have more potential that I'm not realizing? Also, yes. I spend too much time on video games; or so I think. In reality though, I'm in good shape, with good grades, and have a good social circle. Maybe I'm just trying to convince myself. I don't know.  

I understand that I have a shit load of time before the next recruiting cycle. And I hope it will be a lot better than this one. I understand that I don't have to grind leetcode like a maniac every day, just 1 hour a day is enough. I could replace 1 hour of video games with leetcode, but I just don't. I'm 19 years old ffs. Why can't I do what I think I should do? Some day I feel motivated and promise myself that I will stay consistent. Some days, like today, I just feel like a bitch. 

I rationalize by saying that I have a great team, great pay, great conditions for work. But the immense guilt of spending free time just eats me from the outside like something else.

My naive solution was to have an array of created rectangles, then check if the current rectangle fits in all of them. Of course, this solution was met with TLE. 

Optimization I thought of what that we only need to keep track of two created rectangles: one with the minimum length seen so far and one with the minimum width seen so far. We compare the current rectangle with these two rectangles only.

But, I have a final round interview with Microsoft on the 14th of November. Microsoft is my dreammm company, and I want to see if I get an offer from them before deciding. But I'd feel super bad reneging. In my convo with my recruiter tomorrow, do I tell them I have a final round interview with another company? Or do I just ask them to give me a few weeks? Also, with how much of a shitshow this year is for internships, I'm wondering if I should just play it safe— I'm in a great position for a sophomore.

Atlassian: Remote + Not fixed comp, but I assume it’s solid, so I don’t care about comp. I like their company &amp; culture better.

Company A: Seattle + $2400/month housing stipend 


More context: 
I’m really grateful to be in this position, I’m just confused on where to go. I’m a 2nd year with a lot of credits who was planning on graduating in 3, but now thinking 3.5, so would not reneging + mentioning a grad yr extension to Atlassian + keeping me on file for the future sound okay? 

My ideal scenario would be to move Atlassian during the school year, but I didn’t ask them yet since that might look bad and don’t know if it’s even allowed. 

I know Company A has Fall internships AND reneging is usually fine but I still don’t feel comfortable with the idea of reneging, especially in this economy or if I end up blacklisted for a couple years or something etc.

csMajors,"Hello everyone,

I’m an current sophomore who got accepted to participate in JPMorgan’s Code for Good Hackathon at Columbus for the 2023 software engineering internship.

I have participated in 3 hackathons online. However, CFG is the first hackathon that I am participating in person and working for a full 24 hours. Because of these facts, I thought that it would be great if I can get some advice from people that are familiar or participated in CFG. 

I have heard that JPMorgan considers the CFG hackathon as a final round for their software engineering internship. Because of this, I was curious of what my odds are of receiving an offer from JPMorgan after participating in Code for Good. Do they send out offers to most of the people that have participated in CFG?

Are there people who received an offer for an internship/full time after conducting CFG?

Also, after conducting the code for good hackathon, are there additional steps or interviews for the internship or do they just send out offers? If so how long do they take to get back with the offer?

Lastly, are there any tips and tricks for success while participating in code for good? Are there any stacks and programming languages that I should learn?(I am familiar with HTML/CSS Java and Python and conducted a couple projects on them)

- Should I focus more on the system design and react, js projects for the interview to assess my skills. (I feel like I’m restricting myself with the languages I know and showcase only a lil.)

So I want to go into CS in college since I liked it in the one class I had and obviously because of the perks of getting a CS degree when looking for work. As I’ve said I’ve only taken one class that was web dev in HTML and I liked it a lot. I’m also very good in math/stats/physics, in APs for those and I also really like those classes.

I often hear that CS as a high drop out rate and it’s partially because people like the idea of the degree but not the actual work.

I was wondering if anyone that took CS in college can tell me if they think I can be a good fit or if I don’t have enough experience to know if I like it or not and perhaps I’m just attracted to the degree for the reputation and salary.

csMajors,"So basically I’m a freshman at a public state college. I came in with so many AP credit hours from high school that after this current semester I will already have 53 hours completed. I’m currently on track to get a BS in software engineering. I talked to my advisor recently and it appears that I could graduate in about two years if I wanted. 

However, my “problem” is that I really don’t want to leave college. I’m enjoying my time here and my long time girlfriend goes here too and will be for the next four years. I also have a full ride scholarship that comes with stipend so if I graduated early I would be throwing away free money that is going towards my education. So now it appears that if I want to stay at college for a normal amount of time I would have to either pick up a double major or go for an early entry masters program and complete that along with my bachelors in four years. 

My plan was always to get a degree, go work for a large FANG or F500 company and then pursue an MBA so I could move up into management type roles. With that in mind, I’m split between double majoring in Software Engineering and Finance, Software Engineering and Math (I’ve heard that math is more useful for finance than finance actually is), or just going for a Masters in Computer Science (which would probably be a lot of work). 
I’ve barely been a college for a full semester so I still don’t really know what classes I enjoy the most yet but it feels like I’m having to make important decisions so soon  because of how far along I already am credit wise. I’m also scared that if I go for a double major I would end up struggling in the upper level courses and hurt my GPA since I don’t have prerequisites to pad it. So yeah…

I’m really kind of lost. Any advice would be appreciated!","Graduate early, double major, or go for a masters?"
